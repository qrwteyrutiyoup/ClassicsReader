<p>Mother of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, delight of Gods and men,</p>
<p>Dear Venus that beneath the gliding stars</p>
<p>Makest to teem the many-voyaged main</p>
<p>And fruitful lands- for all of living things</p>
<p>Through thee alone are evermore conceived,</p>
<p>Through thee are risen to visit the great sun-</p>
<p>Before thee, Goddess, and thy coming on,</p>
<p>Flee stormy wind and massy cloud away,</p>
<p>For thee the daedal Earth bears scented flowers,</p>
<p>For thee waters of the unvexed deep</p>
<p>Smile, and the hollows of the serene sky</p>
<p>Glow with diffused radiance for thee!</p>
<p>For soon as comes the springtime face of day,</p>
<p>And procreant gales blow from the West unbarred,</p>
<p>First fowls of air, smit to the heart by thee,</p>
<p>Foretoken thy approach, O thou Divine,</p>
<p>And leap the wild herds round the happy fields</p>
<p>Or swim the bounding torrents. Thus amain,</p>
<p>Seized with the spell, all creatures follow thee</p>
<p>Whithersoever thou walkest forth to lead,</p>
<p>And thence through seas and mountains and swift streams,</p>
<p>Through leafy homes of birds and greening plains,</p>
<p>Kindling the lure of love in every breast,</p>
<p>Thou bringest the eternal generations forth,</p>
<p>Kind after kind. And since 'tis thou alone</p>
<p>Guidest the Cosmos, and without thee naught</p>
<p>Is risen to reach the shining shores of light,</p>
<p>Nor aught of joyful or of lovely born,</p>
<p>Thee do I crave co-partner in that verse</p>
<p>Which I presume on Nature to compose</p>
<p>For Memmius mine, whom thou hast willed to be</p>
<p>Peerless in every grace at every hour-</p>
<p>Wherefore indeed, Divine one, give my words</p>
<p>Immortal charm. Lull to a timely rest</p>
<p>O'er sea and land the savage works of war,</p>
<p>For thou alone hast power with public peace</p>
<p>To aid mortality; since he who rules</p>
<p>The savage works of battle, puissant Mars,</p>
<p>How often to thy bosom flings his strength</p>
<p>O'ermastered by the eternal wound of love-</p>
<p>And there, with eyes and full throat backward thrown,</p>
<p>Gazing, my Goddess, open-mouthed at thee,</p>
<p>Pastures on love his greedy sight, his breath</p>
<p>Hanging upon thy lips. Him thus reclined</p>
<p>Fill with thy holy body, round, above!</p>
<p>Pour from those lips soft syllables to win</p>
<p>Peace for the Romans, glorious Lady, peace!</p>
<p>For in a season troublous to the state</p>
<p>Neither may I attend this task of mine</p>
<p>With thought untroubled, nor mid such events</p>
<p>The illustrious scion of the Memmian house</p>
<p>Neglect the civic cause.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="50"/>
<p>And for the rest, summon to judgments true,</p>
<p>Unbusied ears and singleness of mind</p>
<p>Withdrawn from cares; lest these my gifts, arranged</p>
<p>For thee with eager service, thou disdain</p>
<p>Before thou comprehendest: since for thee</p>
<p>I prove the supreme law of Gods and sky,</p>
<p>And the primordial germs of things unfold,</p>
<p>Whence Nature all creates, and multiplies</p>
<p>And fosters all, and whither she resolves</p>
<p>Each in the end when each is overthrown.</p>
<p>This ultimate stock we have devised to name</p>
<p>Procreant atoms, matter, seeds of things,</p>
<p>Or primal bodies, as primal to the world.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="62"/>
<p rend="indent">                         Whilst human kind</p>
<p>Throughout the lands lay miserably crushed</p>
<p>Before all eyes beneath Religion- who</p>
<p>Would show her head along the region skies,</p>
<p>Glowering on mortals with her hideous face-</p>
<p>A Greek it was who first opposing dared</p>
<p>Raise mortal eyes that terror to withstand,</p>
<p>Whom nor the fame of Gods nor lightning's stroke</p>
<p>Nor threatening thunder of the ominous sky</p>
<p>Abashed; but rather chafed to angry zest</p>
<p>His dauntless heart to be the first to rend</p>
<p>The crossbars at the gates of Nature old.</p>
<p>And thus his will and hardy wisdom won;</p>
<p>And forward thus he fared afar, beyond</p>
<p>The flaming ramparts of the world, until</p>
<p>He wandered the unmeasurable All.</p>
<p>Whence he to us, a conqueror, reports</p>
<p>What things can rise to being, what cannot,</p>
<p>And by what law to each its scope prescribed,</p>
<p>Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.</p>
<p>Wherefore Religion now is under foot,</p>
<p>And us his victory now exalts to heaven.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="80"/>
<p rend="indent">  I fear perhaps thou deemest that we fare</p>
<p>An impious road to realms of thought profane;</p>
<p>But 'tis that same religion oftener far</p>
<p>Hath bred the foul impieties of men:</p>
<p>As once at Aulis, the elected chiefs,</p>
<p>Foremost of heroes, Danaan counsellors,</p>
<p>Defiled Diana's altar, virgin queen,</p>
<p>With Agamemnon's daughter, foully slain.</p>
<p>She felt the chaplet round her maiden locks</p>
<p>And fillets, fluttering down on either cheek,</p>
<p>And at the altar marked her grieving sire,</p>
<p>The priests beside him who concealed the knife,</p>
<p>And all the folk in tears at sight of her.</p>
<p>With a dumb terror and a sinking knee</p>
<p>She dropped; nor might avail her now that first</p>
<p>'Twas she who gave the king a father's name.</p>
<p>They raised her up, they bore the trembling girl</p>
<p>On to the altar- hither led not now</p>
<p>With solemn rites and hymeneal choir,</p>
<p>But sinless woman, sinfully foredone,</p>
<p>A parent felled her on her bridal day,</p>
<p>Making his child a sacrificial beast</p>
<p>To give the ships auspicious winds for Troy:</p>
<p>Such are the crimes to which Religion leads.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="102"/>
<p rend="indent">  And there shall come the time when even thou,</p>
<p>Forced by the soothsayer's terror-tales, shalt seek</p>
<p>To break from us. Ah, many a dream even now</p>
<p>Can they concoct to rout thy plans of life,</p>
<p>And trouble all thy fortunes with base fears.</p>
<p>I own with reason: for, if men but knew</p>
<p>Some fixed end to ills, they would be strong</p>
<p>By some device unconquered to withstand</p>
<p>Religions and the menacings of seers.</p>
<p>But now nor skill nor instrument is theirs,</p>
<p>Since men must dread eternal pains in death.</p>
<p>For what the soul may be they do not know,</p>
<p>Whether 'tis born, or enter in at birth,</p>
<p>And whether, snatched by death, it die with us,</p>
<p>Or visit the shadows and the vasty caves</p>
<p>Of Orcus, or by some divine decree</p>
<p>Enter the brute herds, as our Ennius sang,</p>
<p>Who first from lovely <placeName key="tgn,2003745">Helicon</placeName> brought down</p>
<p>A laurel wreath of bright perennial leaves,</p>
<p>Renowned forever among the Italian clans.</p>
<p>Yet Ennius too in everlasting verse</p>
<p>Proclaims those vaults of Acheron to be,</p>
<p>Though thence, he said, nor souls nor bodies fare,</p>
<p>But only phantom figures, strangely wan,</p>
<p>And tells how once from out those regions rose</p>
<p>Old Homer's ghost to him and shed salt tears</p>
<p>And with his words unfolded Nature's source.</p>
<p>Then be it ours with steady mind to clasp</p>
<p>The purport of the skies- the law behind</p>
<p>The wandering courses of the sun and moon;</p>
<p>To scan the powers that speed all life below;</p>
<p>But most to see with reasonable eyes</p>
<p>Of what the mind, of what the soul is made,</p>
<p>And what it is so terrible that breaks</p>
<p>On us asleep, or waking in disease,</p>
<p>Until we seem to mark and hear at hand</p>
<p>Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="136"/>
<p rend="indent">  I know how hard it is in Latian verse</p>
<p>To tell the dark discoveries of the Greeks,</p>
<p>Chiefly because our pauper-speech must find</p>
<p>Strange terms to fit the strangeness of the thing;</p>
<p>Yet worth of thine and the expected joy</p>
<p>Of thy sweet friendship do persuade me on</p>
<p>To bear all toil and wake the clear nights through,</p>
<p>Seeking with what of words and what of song</p>
<p>I may at last most gloriously uncloud</p>
<p>For thee the light beyond, wherewith to view</p>
<p>The core of being at the centre hid.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="146"/>


<p>This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,</p>
<p>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</p>
<p>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</p>
<p>But only Nature's aspect and her law,</p>
<p>Which, teaching us, hath this exordium:</p>
<p>Nothing from nothing ever yet was born.</p>
<p>Fear holds dominion over mortality</p>
<p>Only because, seeing in land and sky</p>
<p>So much the cause whereof no wise they know,</p>
<p>Men think Divinities are working there.</p>
<p>Meantime, when once we know from nothing still</p>
<p>Nothing can be create, we shall divine</p>
<p>More clearly what we seek: those elements</p>
<p>From which alone all things created are,</p>
<p>And how accomplished by no tool of Gods.</p>
<p>Suppose all sprang from all things: any kind</p>
<p>Might take its origin from any thing,</p>
<p>No fixed seed required. Men from the sea</p>
<p>Might rise, and from the land the scaly breed,</p>
<p>And, fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky;</p>
<p>The horned cattle, the herds and all the wild</p>
<p>Would haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste;</p>
<p>Nor would the same fruits keep their olden trees,</p>
<p>But each might grow from any stock or limb</p>
<p>By chance and change. Indeed, and were there not</p>
<p>For each its procreant atoms, could things have</p>
<p>Each its unalterable mother old?</p>
<p>But, since produced from fixed seeds are all,</p>
<p>Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light</p>
<p>From its own stuff, from its own primal bodies.</p>
<p>And all from all cannot become, because</p>
<p>In each resides a secret power its own.</p>
<p>Again, why see we lavished o'er the lands</p>
<p>At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn,</p>
<p>The vines that mellow when the autumn lures,</p>
<p>If not because the fixed seeds of things</p>
<p>At their own season must together stream,</p>
<p>And new creations only be revealed</p>
<p>When the due times arrive and pregnant earth</p>
<p>Safely may give unto the shores of light</p>
<p>Her tender progenies? But if from naught</p>
<p>Were their becoming, they would spring abroad</p>
<p>Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months,</p>
<p>With no primordial germs, to be preserved</p>
<p>From procreant unions at an adverse hour.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="185"/>
<p>Nor on the mingling of the living seeds</p>
<p>Would space be needed for the growth of things</p>
<p>Were life an increment of nothing: then</p>
<p>The tiny babe forthwith would walk a man,</p>
<p>And from the turf would leap a branching tree-</p>
<p>Wonders unheard of; for, by Nature, each</p>
<p>Slowly increases from its lawful seed,</p>
<p>And through that increase shall conserve its kind.</p>
<p>Whence take the proof that things enlarge and feed</p>
<p>From out their proper matter. Thus it comes</p>
<p>That earth, without her seasons of fixed rains,</p>
<p>Could bear no produce such as makes us glad,</p>
<p>And whatsoever lives, if shut from food,</p>
<p>Prolongs its kind and guards its life no more.</p>
<p>Thus easier 'tis to hold that many things</p>
<p>Have primal bodies in common (as we see</p>
<p>The single letters common to many words)</p>
<p>Than aught exists without its origins.</p>
<p>Moreover, why should Nature not prepare</p>
<p>Men of a bulk to ford the seas afoot,</p>
<p>Or rend the mighty mountains with their hands,</p>
<p>Or conquer Time with length of days, if not</p>
<p>Because for all begotten things abides</p>
<p>The changeless stuff, and what from that may spring</p>
<p>Is fixed forevermore? Lastly we see</p>
<p>How far the tilled surpass the fields untilled</p>
<p>And to the labour of our hands return</p>
<p>Their more abounding crops; there are indeed</p>
<p>Within the earth primordial germs of things,</p>
<p>Which, as the ploughshare turns the fruitful clods</p>
<p>And kneads the mould, we quicken into birth.</p>
<p>Else would ye mark, without all toil of ours,</p>
<p>Spontaneous generations, fairer forms.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="205"/>
<p>Confess then, naught from nothing can become,</p>
<p>Since all must have their seeds, wherefrom to grow,</p>
<p>Wherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air.</p>
<p>Hence too it comes that Nature all dissolves</p>
<p>Into their primal bodies again, and naught</p>
<p>Perishes ever to annihilation.</p>
<p>For, were aught mortal in its every part,</p>
<p>Before our eyes it might be snatched away</p>
<p>Unto destruction; since no force were needed</p>
<p>To sunder its members and undo its bands.</p>
<p>Whereas, of truth, because all things exist,</p>
<p>With seed imperishable, Nature allows</p>
<p>Destruction nor collapse of aught, until</p>
<p>Some outward force may shatter by a blow,</p>
<p>Or inward craft, entering its hollow cells,</p>
<p>Dissolve it down. And more than this, if Time,</p>
<p>That wastes with eld the works along the world,</p>
<p>Destroy entire, consuming matter all,</p>
<p>Whence then may <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> back to light of life</p>
<p>Restore the generations kind by kind?</p>
<p>Or how, when thus restored, may daedal Earth</p>
<p>Foster and plenish with her ancient food,</p>
<p>Which, kind by kind, she offers unto each?</p>
<p>Whence may the water-springs, beneath the sea,</p>
<p>Or inland rivers, far and wide away,</p>
<p>Keep the unfathomable ocean full?</p>
<p>And out of what does Ether feed the stars?</p>
<p>For lapsed years and infinite age must else</p>
<p>Have eat all shapes of mortal stock away:</p>
<p>But be it the Long Ago contained those germs,</p>
<p>By which this sum of things recruited lives,</p>
<p>Those same infallibly can never die,</p>
<p>Nor nothing to nothing evermore return.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="238"/>
<p>And, too, the selfsame power might end alike</p>
<p>All things, were they not still together held</p>
<p>By matter eternal, shackled through its parts,</p>
<p>Now more, now less. A touch might be enough</p>
<p>To cause destruction. For the slightest force</p>
<p>Would loose the weft of things wherein no part</p>
<p>Were of imperishable stock. But now</p>
<p>Because the fastenings of primordial parts</p>
<p>Are put together diversely and stuff</p>
<p>Is everlasting, things abide the same</p>
<p>Unhurt and sure, until some power comes on</p>
<p>Strong to destroy the warp and woof of each:</p>
<p>Nothing returns to naught; but all return</p>
<p>At their collapse to primal forms of stuff.</p>
<p>Lo, the rains perish which Ether-father throws</p>
<p>Down to the bosom of Earth-mother; but then</p>
<p>Upsprings the shining grain, and boughs are green</p>
<p>Amid the trees, and trees themselves wax big</p>
<p>And lade themselves with fruits; and hence in turn</p>
<p>The race of man and all the wild are fed;</p>
<p>Hence joyful cities thrive with boys and girls;</p>
<p>And leafy woodlands echo with new birds;</p>
<p>Hence cattle, fat and drowsy, lay their bulk</p>
<p>Along the joyous pastures whilst the drops</p>
<p>Of white ooze trickle from distended bags;</p>
<p>Hence the young scamper on their weakling joints</p>
<p>Along the tender herbs, fresh hearts afrisk</p>
<p>With warm new milk. Thus naught of what so seems</p>
<p>Perishes utterly, since Nature ever</p>
<p>Upbuilds one thing from other, suffering naught</p>
<p>To come to birth but through some other's death.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>And now, since I have taught that things cannot</p>
<p>Be born from nothing, nor the same, when born,</p>
<p>To nothing be recalled, doubt not my words,</p>
<p>Because our eyes no primal germs perceive;</p>
<p>For mark those bodies which, though known to be</p>
<p>In this our world, are yet invisible:</p>
<p>The winds infuriate lash our face and frame,</p>
<p>Unseen, and swamp huge ships and rend the clouds,</p>
<p>Or, eddying wildly down, bestrew the plains</p>
<p>With mighty trees, or scour the mountain tops</p>
<p>With forest-crackling blasts. Thus on they rave</p>
<p>With uproar shrill and ominous moan. The winds,</p>
<p>'Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through</p>
<p>The sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky,</p>
<p>Vexing and whirling and seizing all amain;</p>
<p>And forth they flow and pile destruction round,</p>
<p>Even as the water's soft and supple bulk</p>
<p>Becoming a river of abounding floods,</p>
<p>Which a wide downpour from the lofty hills</p>
<p>Swells with big showers, dashes headlong down</p>
<p>Fragments of woodland and whole branching trees;</p>
<p>Nor can the solid bridges bide the shock</p>
<p>As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream,</p>
<p>Strong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers,</p>
<p>Crashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves</p>
<p>Down-toppled masonry and ponderous stone,</p>
<p>Hurling away whatever would oppose.</p>
<p>Even so must move the blasts of all the winds,</p>
<p>Which, when they spread, like to a mighty flood,</p>
<p>Hither or thither, drive things on before</p>
<p>And hurl to ground with still renewed assault,</p>
<p>Or sometimes in their circling vortex seize</p>
<p>And bear in cones of whirlwind down the world:</p>
<p>The winds are sightless bodies and naught else-</p>
<p>Since both in works and ways they rival well</p>
<p>The mighty rivers, the visible in form.</p>
<p>Then too we know the varied smells of things</p>
<p>Yet never to our nostrils see them come;</p>
<p>With eyes we view not burning heats, nor cold,</p>
<p>Nor are we wont men's voices to behold.</p>
<p>Yet these must be corporeal at the base,</p>
<p>Since thus they smite the senses: naught there is</p>
<p>Save body, having property of touch.</p>
<p>And raiment, hung by surf-beat shore, grows moist,</p>
<p>The same, spread out before the sun, will dry;</p>
<p>Yet no one saw how sank the moisture in,</p>
<p>Nor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know,</p>
<p>That moisture is dispersed about in bits</p>
<p>Too small for eyes to see. Another case:</p>
<p>A ring upon the finger thins away</p>
<p>Along the under side, with years and suns;</p>
<p>The drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone;</p>
<p>The hooked ploughshare, though of iron, wastes</p>
<p>Amid the fields insidiously. We view</p>
<p>The rock-paved highways worn by many feet;</p>
<p>And at the gates the brazen statues show</p>
<p>Their right hands leaner from the frequent touch</p>
<p>Of wayfarers innumerable who greet.</p>
<p>We see how wearing-down hath minished these,</p>
<p>But just what motes depart at any time,</p>
<p>The envious nature of vision bars our sight.</p>
<p>Lastly whatever days and nature add</p>
<p>Little by little, constraining things to grow</p>
<p>In due proportion, no gaze however keen</p>
<p>Of these our eyes hath watched and known. No more</p>
<p>Can we observe what's lost at any time,</p>
<p>When things wax old with eld and foul decay,</p>
<p>Or when salt seas eat under beetling crags.</p>
<p>Thus Nature ever by unseen bodies works.</p>
 
<milestone unit="card" n="329"/>

<p>But yet creation's neither crammed nor blocked</p>
<p>About by body: there's in things a void-</p>
<p>Which to have known will serve thee many a turn,</p>
<p>Nor will not leave thee wandering in doubt,</p>
<p>Forever searching in the sum of all,</p>
<p>And losing faith in these pronouncements mine.</p>
<p>There's place intangible, a void and room.</p>
<p>For were it not, things could in nowise move;</p>
<p>Since body's property to block and check</p>
<p>Would work on all and at an times the same.</p>
<p>Thus naught could evermore push forth and go,</p>
<p>Since naught elsewhere would yield a starting place.</p>
<p>But now through oceans, lands, and heights of heaven,</p>
<p>By divers causes and in divers modes,</p>
<p>Before our eyes we mark how much may move,</p>
<p>Which, finding not a void, would fail deprived</p>
<p>Of stir and motion; nay, would then have been</p>
<p>Nowise begot at all, since matter, then,</p>
<p>Had staid at rest, its parts together crammed.</p>
<p>Then too, however solid objects seem,</p>
<p>They yet are formed of matter mixed with void:</p>
<p>In rocks and caves the watery moisture seeps,</p>
<p>And beady drops stand out like plenteous tears;</p>
<p>And food finds way through every frame that lives;</p>
<p>The trees increase and yield the season's fruit</p>
<p>Because their food throughout the whole is poured,</p>
<p>Even from the deepest roots, through trunks and boughs;</p>
<p>And voices pass the solid walls and fly</p>
<p>Reverberant through shut doorways of a house;</p>
<p>And stiffening frost seeps inward to our bones.</p>
<p>Which but for voids for bodies to go through</p>
<p>'Tis clear could happen in nowise at all.</p>
<p>Again, why see we among objects some</p>
<p>Of heavier weight, but of no bulkier size?</p>
<p>Indeed, if in a ball of wool there be</p>
<p>As much of body as in lump of lead,</p>
<p>The two should weigh alike, since body tends</p>
<p>To load things downward, while the void abides,</p>
<p>By contrary nature, the imponderable.</p>
<p>Therefore, an object just as large but lighter</p>
<p>Declares infallibly its more of void;</p>
<p>Even as the heavier more of matter shows,</p>
<p>And how much less of vacant room inside.</p>
<p>That which we're seeking with sagacious quest</p>
<p>Exists, infallibly, commixed with things-</p>
<p>The void, the invisible inane.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="370" />
<p rend="indent">Right here</p>
<p>I am compelled a question to expound,</p>
<p>Forestalling something certain folk suppose,</p>
<p>Lest it avail to lead thee off from truth:</p>
<p>Waters (they say) before the shining breed</p>
<p>Of the swift scaly creatures somehow give,</p>
<p>And straightway open sudden liquid paths,</p>
<p>Because the fishes leave behind them room</p>
<p>To which at once the yielding billows stream.</p>
<p>Thus things among themselves can yet be moved,</p>
<p>And change their place, however full the Sum-</p>
<p>Received opinion, wholly false forsooth.</p>
<p>For where can scaly creatures forward dart,</p>
<p>Save where the waters give them room? Again,</p>
<p>Where can the billows yield a way, so long</p>
<p>As ever the fish are powerless to go?</p>
<p>Thus either all bodies of motion are deprived,</p>
<p>Or things contain admixture of a void</p>
<p>Where each thing gets its start in moving on.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies</p>
<p>Suddenly spring apart, the air must crowd</p>
<p>The whole new void between those bodies formed;</p>
<p>But air, however it stream with hastening gusts,</p>
<p>Can yet not fill the gap at once- for first</p>
<p>It makes for one place, ere diffused through all.</p>
<p>And then, if haply any think this comes,</p>
<p>When bodies spring apart, because the air</p>
<p>Somehow condenses, wander they from truth:</p>
<p>For then a void is formed, where none before;</p>
<p>And, too, a void is filled which was before.</p>
<p>Nor can air be condensed in such a wise;</p>
<p>Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold,</p>
<p>It still could not contract upon itself</p>
<p>And draw its parts together into one.</p>
<p>Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech,</p>
<p>Confess thou must there is a void in things.</p>
<p rend="indent">  And still I might by many an argument</p>
<p>Here scrape together credence for my words.</p>
<p>But for the keen eye these mere footprints serve,</p>
<p>Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself.</p>
<p>As dogs full oft with noses on the ground,</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="418"/>

<p>But, now again to weave the tale begun,</p>
<p>All nature, then, as self-sustained, consists</p>
<p>Of twain of things: of bodies and of void</p>
<p>In which they're set, and where they're moved around.</p>
<p>For common instinct of our race declares</p>
<p>That body of itself exists: unless</p>
<p>This primal faith, deep-founded, fail us not,</p>
<p>Naught will there be whereunto to appeal</p>
<p>On things occult when seeking aught to prove</p>
<p>By reasonings of mind. Again, without</p>
<p>That place and room, which we do call the inane,</p>
<p>Nowhere could bodies then be set, nor go</p>
<p>Hither or thither at all- as shown before.</p>
<p>Besides, there's naught of which thou canst declare</p>
<p>It lives disjoined from body, shut from void-</p>
<p>A kind of third in nature. For whatever</p>
<p>Exists must be a somewhat; and the same,</p>
<p>If tangible, however fight and slight,</p>
<p>Will yet increase the count of body's sum,</p>
<p>With its own augmentation big or small;</p>
<p>But, if intangible and powerless ever</p>
<p>To keep a thing from passing through itself</p>
<p>On any side, 'twill be naught else but that</p>
<p>Which we do call the empty, the inane.</p>
<p>Again, whate'er exists, as of itself,</p>
<p>Must either act or suffer action on it,</p>
<p>Or else be that wherein things move and be:</p>
<p>Naught, saving body, acts, is acted on;</p>
<p>Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus,</p>
<p>Beside the inane and bodies, is no third</p>
<p>Nature amid the number of all things-</p>
<p>Remainder none to fall at any time</p>
<p>Under our senses, nor be seized and seen</p>
<p>By any man through reasonings of mind.</p>
<p>Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt,</p>
<p>Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain,</p>
<p>Or see but accidents those twain produce.</p>
<p rend="indent">  A property is that which not at all</p>
<p>Can be disjoined and severed from a thing</p>
<p>Without a fatal dissolution: such,</p>
<p>Weight to the rocks, heat to the fire, and flow</p>
<p>To the wide waters, touch to corporal things,</p>
<p>Intangibility to the viewless void.</p>
<p>But state of slavery, pauperhood, and wealth,</p>
<p>Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else</p>
<p>Which come and go whilst nature stands the same,</p>
<p>We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents.</p>
<p>Even time exists not of itself; but sense</p>
<p>Reads out of things what happened long ago,</p>
<p>What presses now, and what shall follow after:</p>
<p>No man, we must admit, feels time itself,</p>
<p>Disjoined from motion and repose of things.</p>
<p>Thus, when they say there "is" the ravishment</p>
<p>Of Princess Helen, "is" the siege and sack</p>
<p>Of Trojan Town, look out, they force us not</p>
<p>To admit these acts existent by themselves,</p>
<p>Merely because those races of mankind</p>
<p>(Of whom these acts were accidents) long since</p>
<p>Irrevocable age has borne away:</p>
<p>For all past actions may be said to be</p>
<p>But accidents, in one way, of mankind,-</p>
<p>In other, of some region of the world.</p>
<p>Add, too, had been no matter, and no room</p>
<p>Wherein all things go on, the fire of love</p>
<p>Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal</p>
<p>Under the Phrygian Alexander's breast,</p>
<p>Had ne'er enkindled that renowned strife</p>
<p>Of savage war, nor had the wooden horse</p>
<p>Involved in flames old Pergama, by a birth</p>
<p>At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes.</p>
<p>And thus thou canst remark that every act</p>
<p>At bottom exists not of itself, nor is</p>
<p>As body is, nor has like name with void;</p>
<p>But rather of sort more fitly to be called</p>
<p>An accident of body, and of place</p>
<p>Wherein all things go on.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="483"/>

<p rend="indent">                        Bodies, again,</p>
<p>Are partly primal germs of things, and partly</p>
<p>Unions deriving from the primal germs.</p>
<p>And those which are the primal germs of things</p>
<p>No power can quench; for in the end they conquer</p>
<p>By their own solidness; though hard it be</p>
<p>To think that aught in things has solid frame;</p>
<p>For lightnings pass, no less than voice and shout,</p>
<p>Through hedging walls of houses, and the iron</p>
<p>White-dazzles in the fire, and rocks will burn</p>
<p>With exhalations fierce and burst asunder.</p>
<p>Totters the rigid gold dissolved in heat;</p>
<p>The ice of bronze melts conquered in the flame;</p>
<p>Warmth and the piercing cold through silver seep,</p>
<p>Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand,</p>
<p>We oft feel both, as from above is poured</p>
<p>The dew of waters between their shining sides:</p>
<p>So true it is no solid form is found.</p>
<p>But yet because true reason and nature of things</p>
<p>Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now</p>
<p>I disentangle how there still exist</p>
<p>Bodies of solid, everlasting frame-</p>
<p>The seeds of things, the primal germs we teach,</p>
<p>Whence all creation around us came to be.</p>
<p>First since we know a twofold nature exists,</p>
<p>Of things, both twain and utterly unlike-</p>
<p>Body, and place in which an things go on-</p>
<p>Then each must be both for and through itself,</p>
<p>And all unmixed: where'er be empty space,</p>
<p>There body's not; and so where body bides,</p>
<p>There not at all exists the void inane.</p>
<p>Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void.</p>
<p>But since there's void in all begotten things,</p>
<p>All solid matter must be round the same;</p>
<p>Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides</p>
<p>And holds a void within its body, unless</p>
<p>Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know,</p>
<p>That which can hold a void of things within</p>
<p>Can be naught else than matter in union knit.</p>
<p>Thus matter, consisting of a solid frame,</p>
<p>Hath power to be eternal, though all else,</p>
<p>Though all creation, be dissolved away.</p>
<p>Again, were naught of empty and inane,</p>
<p>The world were then a solid; as, without</p>
<p>Some certain bodies to fill the places held,</p>
<p>The world that is were but a vacant void.</p>
<p>And so, infallibly, alternate-wise</p>
<p>Body and void are still distinguished,</p>
<p>Since nature knows no wholly full nor void.</p>
<p>There are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power</p>
<p>To vary forever the empty and the full;</p>
<p>And these can nor be sundered from without</p>
<p>By beats and blows, nor from within be torn</p>
<p>By penetration, nor be overthrown</p>
<p>By any assault soever through the world-</p>
<p>For without void, naught can be crushed, it seems,</p>
<p>Nor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain,</p>
<p>Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold</p>
<p>Or piercing fire, those old destroyers three;</p>
<p>But the more void within a thing, the more</p>
<p>Entirely it totters at their sure assault.</p>
<p>Thus if first bodies be, as I have taught,</p>
<p>Solid, without a void, they must be then</p>
<p>Eternal; and, if matter ne'er had been</p>
<p>Eternal, long ere now had all things gone</p>
<p>Back into nothing utterly, and all</p>
<p>We see around from nothing had been born-</p>
<p>But since I taught above that naught can be</p>
<p>From naught created, nor the once begotten</p>
<p>To naught be summoned back, these primal germs</p>
<p>Must have an immortality of frame.</p>
<p>And into these must each thing be resolved,</p>
<p>When comes its supreme hour, that thus there be</p>
<p>At hand the stuff for plenishing the world.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>So primal germs have solid singleness</p>
<p>Nor otherwise could they have been conserved</p>
<p>Through aeons and infinity of time</p>
<p>For the replenishment of wasted worlds.</p>
<p>Once more, if nature had given a scope for things</p>
<p>To be forever broken more and more,</p>
<p>By now the bodies of matter would have been</p>
<p>So far reduced by breakings in old days</p>
<p>That from them nothing could, at season fixed,</p>
<p>Be born, and arrive its prime and top of life.</p>
<p>For, lo, each thing is quicker marred than made;</p>
<p>And so whate'er the long infinitude</p>
<p>Of days and all fore-passed time would now</p>
<p>By this have broken and ruined and dissolved,</p>
<p>That same could ne'er in all remaining time</p>
<p>Be builded up for plenishing the world.</p>
<p>But mark: infallibly a fixed bound</p>
<p>Remaineth stablished 'gainst their breaking down;</p>
<p>Since we behold each thing soever renewed,</p>
<p>And unto all, their seasons, after their kind,</p>
<p>Wherein they arrive the flower of their age.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="551" />
<p rend="indent">    Again, if bounds have not been set against</p>
<p>The breaking down of this corporeal world,</p>
<p>Yet must all bodies of whatever things</p>
<p>Have still endured from everlasting time</p>
<p>Unto this present, as not yet assailed</p>
<p>By shocks of peril. But because the same</p>
<p>Are, to thy thinking, of a nature frail,</p>
<p>It ill accords that thus they could remain</p>
<p>(As thus they do) through everlasting time,</p>
<p>Vexed through the ages (as indeed they are)</p>
<p>By the innumerable blows of chance.</p>
<p rend="indent">  So in our programme of creation, mark</p>
<p>How 'tis that, though the bodies of all stuff</p>
<p>Are solid to the core, we yet explain</p>
<p>The ways whereby some things are fashioned soft-</p>
<p>Air, water, earth, and fiery exhalations-</p>
<p>And by what force they function and go on:</p>
<p>The fact is founded in the void of things.</p>
<p>But if the primal germs themselves be soft,</p>
<p>Reason cannot be brought to bear to show</p>
<p>The ways whereby may be created these</p>
<p>Great crags of basalt and the during iron;</p>
<p>For their whole nature will profoundly lack</p>
<p>The first foundations of a solid frame.</p>
<p>But powerful in old simplicity,</p>
<p>Abide the solid, the primeval germs;</p>
<p>And by their combinations more condensed,</p>
<p>All objects can be tightly knit and bound</p>
<p>And made to show unconquerable strength.</p>
<p>Again, since all things kind by kind obtain</p>
<p>Fixed bounds of growing and conserving life;</p>
<p>Since Nature hath inviolably decreed</p>
<p>What each can do, what each can never do;</p>
<p>Since naught is changed, but all things so abide</p>
<p>That ever the variegated birds reveal</p>
<p>The spots or stripes peculiar to their kind,</p>
<p>Spring after spring: thus surely all that is</p>
<p>Must be composed of matter immutable.</p>
<p>For if the primal germs in any wise</p>
<p>Were open to conquest and to change, 'twould be</p>
<p>Uncertain also what could come to birth</p>
<p>And what could not, and by what law to each</p>
<p>Its scope prescribed, its boundary stone that clings</p>
<p>So deep in Time. Nor could the generations</p>
<p>Kind after kind so often reproduce</p>
<p>The nature, habits, motions, ways of life,</p>
<p>Of their progenitors.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="599"/>
<p rend="indent">                              And then again,</p>
<p>Since there is ever an extreme bounding point</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Of that first body which our senses now</p>
<p>Cannot perceive: That bounding point indeed</p>
<p>Exists without all parts, a minimum</p>
<p>Of nature, nor was e'er a thing apart,</p>
<p>As of itself,- nor shall hereafter be,</p>
<p>Since 'tis itself still parcel of another,</p>
<p>A first and single part, whence other parts</p>
<p>And others similar in order lie</p>
<p>In a packed phalanx, filling to the full</p>
<p>The nature of first body: being thus</p>
<p>Not self-existent, they must cleave to that</p>
<p>From which in nowise they can sundered be.</p>
<p>So primal germs have solid singleness,</p>
<p>Which tightly packed and closely joined cohere</p>
<p>By virtue of their minim particles-</p>
<p>No compound by mere union of the same;</p>
<p>But strong in their eternal singleness,</p>
<p>Nature, reserving them as seeds for things,</p>
<p>Permitteth naught of rupture or decrease.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Moreover, were there not a minimum,</p>
<p>The smallest bodies would have infinites,</p>
<p>Since then a half-of-half could still be halved,</p>
<p>With limitless division less and less.</p>
<p>Then what the difference 'twixt the sum and least?</p>
<p>None: for however infinite the sum,</p>
<p>Yet even the smallest would consist the same</p>
<p>Of infinite parts. But since true reason here</p>
<p>Protests, denying that the mind can think it,</p>
<p>Convinced thou must confess such things there are</p>
<p>As have no parts, the minimums of nature.</p>
<p>And since these are, likewise confess thou must</p>
<p>That primal bodies are solid and eterne.</p>
<p>Again, if Nature, creatress of all things,</p>
<p>Were wont to force all things to be resolved</p>
<p>Unto least parts, then would she not avail</p>
<p>To reproduce from out them anything;</p>
<p>Because whate'er is not endowed with parts</p>
<p>Cannot possess those properties required</p>
<p>Of generative stuff- divers connections,</p>
<p>Weights, blows, encounters, motions, whereby things</p>
<p>Forevermore have being and go on.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="635"/>

<p rend="indent">  And on such grounds it is that those who held</p>
<p>The stuff of things is fire, and out of fire</p>
<p>Alone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen</p>
<p>Mightily from true reason to have lapsed.</p>
<p>Of whom, chief leader to do battle, comes</p>
<p>That Heraclitus, famous for dark speech</p>
<p>Among the silly, not the serious Greeks</p>
<p>Who search for truth. For dolts are ever prone</p>
<p>That to bewonder and adore which hides</p>
<p>Beneath distorted words, holding that true</p>
<p>Which sweetly tickles in their stupid ears,</p>
<p>Or which is rouged in finely finished phrase.</p>
<p>For how, I ask, can things so varied be,</p>
<p>If formed of fire, single and pure? No whit</p>
<p>'Twould help for fire to be condensed or thinned,</p>
<p>If all the parts of fire did still preserve</p>
<p>But fire's own nature, seen before in gross.</p>
<p>The heat were keener with the parts compressed,</p>
<p>Milder, again, when severed or dispersed-</p>
<p>And more than this thou canst conceive of naught</p>
<p>That from such causes could become; much less</p>
<p>Might earth's variety of things be born</p>
<p>From any fires soever, dense or rare.</p>
<p>This too: if they suppose a void in things,</p>
<p>Then fires can be condensed and still left rare;</p>
<p>But since they see such opposites of thought</p>
<p>Rising against them, and are loath to leave</p>
<p>An unmixed void in things, they fear the steep</p>
<p>And lose the road of truth. Nor do they see,</p>
<p>That, if from things we take away the void,</p>
<p>All things are then condensed, and out of all</p>
<p>One body made, which has no power to dart</p>
<p>Swiftly from out itself not anything-</p>
<p>As throws the fire its light and warmth around,</p>
<p>Giving thee proof its parts are not compact.</p>
<p>But if perhaps they think, in other wise,</p>
<p>Fires through their combinations can be quenched</p>
<p>And change their substance, very well: behold,</p>
<p>If fire shall spare to do so in no part,</p>
<p>Then heat will perish utterly and all,</p>
<p>And out of nothing would the world be formed.</p>
<p>For change in anything from out its bounds</p>
<p>Means instant death of that which was before;</p>
<p>And thus a somewhat must persist unharmed</p>
<p>Amid the world, lest all return to naught,</p>
<p>And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew.</p>
<p>Now since indeed there are those surest bodies</p>
<p>Which keep their nature evermore the same,</p>
<p>Upon whose going out and coming in</p>
<p>And changed order things their nature change,</p>
<p>And all corporeal substances transformed,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then,</p>
<p>Are not of fire. For 'twere of no avail</p>
<p>Should some depart and go away, and some</p>
<p>Be added new, and some be changed in order,</p>
<p>If still all kept their nature of old heat:</p>
<p>For whatsoever they created then</p>
<p>Would still in any case be only fire.</p>
<p>The truth, I fancy, this: bodies there are</p>
<p>Whose clashings, motions, order, posture, shapes</p>
<p>Produce the fire and which, by order changed,</p>
<p>Do change the nature of the thing produced,</p>
<p>And are thereafter nothing like to fire</p>
<p>Nor whatso else has power to send its bodies</p>
<p>With impact touching on the senses' touch.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Again, to say that all things are but fire</p>
<p>And no true thing in number of all things</p>
<p>Exists but fire, as this same fellow says,</p>
<p>Seems crazed folly. For the man himself</p>
<p>Against the senses by the senses fights,</p>
<p>And hews at that through which is all belief,</p>
<p>Through which indeed unto himself is known</p>
<p>The thing he calls the fire. For, though he thinks</p>
<p>The senses truly can perceive the fire,</p>
<p>He thinks they cannot as regards all else,</p>
<p>Which still are palpably as clear to sense-</p>
<p>To me a thought inept and crazy too.</p>
<p>For whither shall we make appeal? for what</p>
<p>More certain than our senses can there be</p>
<p>Whereby to mark asunder error and truth?</p>
<p>Besides, why rather do away with all,</p>
<p>And wish to allow heat only, then deny</p>
<p>The fire and still allow all else to be?-</p>
<p>Alike the madness either way it seems.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="705"/>
<p>Thus whosoe'er have held the stuff of things</p>
<p>To be but fire, and out of fire the sum,</p>
<p>And whosoever have constituted air</p>
<p>As first beginning of begotten things,</p>
<p>And all whoever have held that of itself</p>
<p>Water alone contrives things, or that earth</p>
<p>Createth all and changes things anew</p>
<p>To divers natures, mightily they seem</p>
<p>A long way to have wandered from the truth.</p>

<p>Most rich in all good things, and fortified</p>
<p>With generous strength of heroes, she hath ne'er</p>
<p>Possessed within her aught of more renown,</p>
<p>Nor aught more holy, wonderful, and dear</p>
<p>Than this true man. Nay, ever so far and pure</p>
<p>The lofty music of his breast divine</p>
<p>Lifts up its voice and tells of glories found,</p>
<p>That scarce he seems of human stock create.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Yet he and those forementioned (known to be</p>
<p>So far beneath him, less than he in all),</p>
<p>Though, as discoverers of much goodly truth,</p>
<p>They gave, as 'twere from out of the heart's own shrine,</p>
<p>Responses holier and soundlier based</p>
<p>Than ever the Pythia pronounced for men</p>
<p>From out the triped and the Delphian laurel,</p>
<p>Have still in matter of first-elements</p>
<p>Made ruin of themselves, and, great men, great</p>
<p>Indeed and heavy there for them the fall:</p>
<p>First, because, banishing the void from things,</p>
<p>They yet assign them motion, and allow</p>
<p>Things soft and loosely textured to exist,</p>
<p>As air, dew, fire, earth, animals, and grains,</p>
<p>Without admixture of void amid their frame.</p>
<p>Next, because, thinking there can be no end</p>
<p>In cutting bodies down to less and less</p>
<p>Nor pause established to their breaking up,</p>
<p>They hold there is no minimum in things;</p>
<p>Albeit we see the boundary point of aught</p>
<p>Is that which to our senses seems its least,</p>
<p>Whereby thou mayst conjecture, that, because</p>
<p>The things thou canst not mark have boundary points,</p>
<p>They surely have their minimums. Then, too,</p>
<p>Since these philosophers ascribe to things</p>
<p>Soft primal germs, which we behold to be</p>
<p>Of birth and body mortal, thus, throughout,</p>
<p>The sum of things must be returned to naught,</p>
<p>And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew-</p>
<p>Thou seest how far each doctrine stands from truth.</p>
<p>And, next, these bodies are among themselves</p>
<p>In many ways poisons and foes to each,</p>
<p>Wherefore their congress will destroy them quite</p>
<p>Or drive asunder as we see in storms</p>
<p>Rains, winds, and lightnings all asunder fly.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="763"/>
<p rend="indent">  Thus too, if all things are create of four,</p>
<p>And all again dissolved into the four,</p>
<p>How can the four be called the primal germs</p>
<p>Of things, more than all things themselves be thought,</p>
<p>By retroversion, primal germs of them?</p>
<p>For ever alternately are both begot,</p>
<p>With interchange of nature and aspect</p>
<p>From immemorial time. But if percase</p>
<p>Thou think'st the frame of fire and earth, the air,</p>
<p>The dew of water can in such wise meet</p>
<p>As not by mingling to resign their nature,</p>
<p>From them for thee no world can be create-</p>
<p>No thing of breath, no stock or stalk of tree:</p>
<p>In the wild congress of this varied heap</p>
<p>Each thing its proper nature will display,</p>
<p>And air will palpably be seen mixed up</p>
<p>With earth together, unquenched heat with water.</p>
<p>But primal germs in bringing things to birth</p>
<p>Must have a latent, unseen quality,</p>
<p>Lest some outstanding alien element</p>
<p>Confuse and minish in the thing create</p>
<p>Its proper being.</p>
<p rend="indent">                     But these men begin</p>
<p>From heaven, and from its fires; and first they feign</p>
<p>That fire will turn into the winds of air,</p>
<p>Next, that from air the rain begotten is,</p>
<p>And earth created out of rain, and then</p>
<p>That all, reversely, are returned from earth-</p>
<p>The moisture first, then air thereafter heat-</p>
<p>And that these same ne'er cease in interchange,</p>
<p>To go their ways from heaven to earth, from earth</p>
<p>Unto the stars of the aethereal world-</p>
<p>Which in no wise at all the germs can do.</p>
<p>Since an immutable somewhat still must be,</p>
<p>Lest all things utterly be sped to naught;</p>
<p>For change in anything from out its bounds</p>
<p>Means instant death of that which was before.</p>
<p>Wherefore, since those things, mentioned heretofore,</p>
<p>Suffer a changed state, they must derive</p>
<p>From others ever unconvertible,</p>
<p>Lest an things utterly return to naught.</p>
<p>Then why not rather presuppose there be</p>
<p>Bodies with such a nature furnished forth</p>
<p>That, if perchance they have created fire,</p>
<p>Can still (by virtue of a few withdrawn,</p>
<p>Or added few, and motion and order changed)</p>
<p>Fashion the winds of air, and thus all things</p>
<p>Forevermore be interchanged with all?</p>
<p rend="indent">  "But facts in proof are manifest," thou sayest,</p>
<p>"That all things grow into the winds of air</p>
<p>And forth from earth are nourished, and unless</p>
<p>The season favour at propitious hour</p>
<p>With rains enough to set the trees a-reel</p>
<p>Under the soak of bulking thunderheads,</p>
<p>And sun, for its share, foster and give heat,</p>
<p>No grains, nor trees, nor breathing things can grow."</p>
<p>True- and unless hard food and moisture soft</p>
<p>Recruited man, his frame would waste away,</p>
<p>And life dissolve from out his thews and bones;</p>
<p>For out of doubt recruited and fed are we</p>
<p>By certain things, as other things by others.</p>
<p>Because in many ways the many germs</p>
<p>Common to many things are mixed in things,</p>
<p>No wonder 'tis that therefore divers things</p>
<p>By divers things are nourished. And, again,</p>
<p>Often it matters vastly with what others,</p>
<p>In what positions the primordial germs</p>
<p>Are bound together, and what motions, too,</p>
<p>They give and get among themselves; for these</p>
<p>Same germs do put together sky, sea, lands,</p>
<p>Rivers, and sun, grains, trees, and breathing things,</p>
<p>But yet commixed they are in divers modes</p>
<p>With divers things, forever as they move.</p>
<p>Nay, thou beholdest in our verses here</p>
<p>Elements many, common to many worlds,</p>
<p>Albeit thou must confess each verse, each word</p>
<p>From one another differs both in sense</p>
<p>And ring of sound- so much the elements</p>
<p>Can bring about by change of order alone.</p>
<p>But those which are the primal germs of things</p>
<p>Have power to work more combinations still,</p>
<p>Whence divers things can be produced in turn.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="830"/>
<p rend="indent">  Now let us also take for scrutiny</p>
<p>The homeomeria of Anaxagoras,</p>
<p>So called by Greeks, for which our pauper-speech</p>
<p>Yieldeth no name in the Italian tongue,</p>
<p>Although the thing itself is not o'erhard</p>
<p>For explanation. First, then, when he speaks</p>
<p>Of this homeomeria of things, he thinks</p>
<p>Bones to be sprung from littlest bones minute,</p>
<p>And from minute and littlest flesh all flesh,</p>
<p>And blood created out of drops of blood,</p>
<p>Conceiving gold compact of grains of gold,</p>
<p>And earth concreted out of bits of earth,</p>
<p>Fire made of fires, and water out of waters,</p>
<p>Feigning the like with all the rest of stuff.</p>
<p>Yet he concedes not any void in things,</p>
<p>Nor any limit to cutting bodies down.</p>
<p>Wherefore to me he seems on both accounts</p>
<p>To err no less than those we named before.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="847"/>
<p>Add too: these germs he feigns are far too frail-</p>
<p>If they be germs primordial furnished forth</p>
<p>With but same nature as the things themselves,</p>
<p>And travail and perish equally with those,</p>
<p>And no rein curbs them from annihilation.</p>
<p>For which will last against the grip and crush</p>
<p>Under the teeth of death? the fire? the moist?</p>
<p>Or else the air? which then? the blood? the bones?</p>
<p>No one, methinks, when every thing will be</p>
<p>At bottom as mortal as whate'er we mark</p>
<p>To perish by force before our gazing eyes.</p>
<p>But my appeal is to the proofs above</p>
<p>That things cannot fall back to naught, nor yet</p>
<p>From naught increase. And now again, since food</p>
<p>Augments and nourishes the human frame,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know our veins and blood and bones</p>
<p>And thews are formed of particles unlike</p>
<p>To them in kind; or if they say all foods</p>
<p>Are of mixed substance having in themselves</p>
<p>Small bodies of thews, and bones, and also veins</p>
<p>And particles of blood, then every food,</p>
<p>Solid or liquid, must itself be thought</p>
<p>As made and mixed of things unlike in kind-</p>
<p>Of bones, of thews, of ichor and of blood.</p>
<p>Again, if all the bodies which upgrow</p>
<p>From earth, are first within the earth, then earth</p>
<p>Must be compound of alien substances.</p>
<p>Which spring and bloom abroad from out the earth.</p>
<p>Transfer the argument, and thou may'st use</p>
<p>The selfsame words: if flame and smoke and ash</p>
<p>Still lurk unseen within the wood, the wood</p>
<p>Must be compound of alien substances</p>
<p>Which spring from out the wood.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="875"/>
<p rend="indent">                            Right here remains</p>
<p>A certain slender means to skulk from truth,</p>
<p>Which Anaxagoras takes unto himself,</p>
<p>Who holds that all things lurk commixed with all</p>
<p>While that one only comes to view, of which</p>
<p>The bodies exceed in number all the rest,</p>
<p>And lie more close to hand and at the fore-</p>
<p>A notion banished from true reason far.</p>
<p>For then 'twere meet that kernels of the grains</p>
<p>Should oft, when crunched between the might of stones,</p>
<p>Give forth a sign of blood, or of aught else</p>
<p>Which in our human frame is fed; and that</p>
<p>Rock rubbed on rock should yield a gory ooze.</p>
<p>Likewise the herbs ought oft to give forth drops</p>
<p>Of sweet milk, flavoured like the uddered sheep's;</p>
<p>Indeed we ought to find, when crumbling up</p>
<p>The earthy clods, there herbs, and grains, and leaves,</p>
<p>All sorts dispersed minutely in the soil;</p>
<p>Lastly we ought to find in cloven wood</p>
<p>Ashes and smoke and bits of fire there hid.</p>
<p>But since fact teaches this is not the case,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know things are not mixed with things</p>
<p>Thuswise; but seeds, common to many things,</p>
<p>Commixed in many ways, must lurk in things.</p>
<p rend="indent">  "But often it happens on skiey hills" thou sayest,</p>
<p>"That neighbouring tops of lofty trees are rubbed</p>
<p>One against other, smote by the blustering south,</p>
<p>Till all ablaze with bursting flower of flame."</p>
<p>Good sooth- yet fire is not ingraft in wood,</p>
<p>But many are the seeds of heat, and when</p>
<p>Rubbing together they together flow,</p>
<p>They start the conflagrations in the forests.</p>
<p>Whereas if flame, already fashioned, lay</p>
<p>Stored up within the forests, then the fires</p>
<p>Could not for any time be kept unseen,</p>
<p>But would be laying all the wildwood waste</p>
<p>And burning all the boscage. Now dost see</p>
<p>(Even as we said a little space above)</p>
<p>How mightily it matters with what others,</p>
<p>In what positions these same primal germs</p>
<p>Are bound together? And what motions, too,</p>
<p>They give and get among themselves? how, hence,</p>
<p>The same, if altered 'mongst themselves, can body</p>
<p>Both igneous and ligneous objects forth-</p>
<p>Precisely as these words themselves are made</p>
<p>By somewhat altering their elements,</p>
<p>Although we mark with name indeed distinct</p>
<p>The igneous from the ligneous. Once again,</p>
<p>If thou suppose whatever thou beholdest,</p>
<p>Among all visible objects, cannot be,</p>
<p>Unless thou feign bodies of matter endowed</p>
<p>With a like nature,- by thy vain device</p>
<p>For thee will perish all the germs of things:</p>
<p>'Twill come to pass they'll laugh aloud, like men,</p>
<p>Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,</p>
<p>Or moisten with salty tear-drops cheeks and chins.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Now learn of what remains! More keenly hear!</p>
<p>And for myself, my mind is not deceived</p>
<p>How dark it is: But the large hope of praise</p>
<p>Hath strook with pointed thyrsus through my heart;</p>
<p>On the same hour hath strook into my breast</p>
<p>Sweet love of the Muses, wherewith now instinct,</p>
<p>I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,</p>
<p>Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,</p>
<p>Trodden by step of none before. I joy</p>
<p>To come on undefiled fountains there,</p>
<p>To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,</p>
<p>To seek for this my head a signal crown</p>
<p>From regions where the Muses never yet</p>
<p>Have garlanded the temples of a man:</p>
<p>First, since I teach concerning mighty things,</p>
<p>And go right on to loose from round the mind</p>
<p>The tightened coils of dread religion;</p>
<p>Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame</p>
<p>Songs so pellucid, touching all throughout</p>
<p>Even with the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem,</p>
<p>Is not without a reasonable ground:</p>
<p>But as physicians, when they seek to give</p>
<p>Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch</p>
<p>The brim around the cup with the sweet juice</p>
<p>And yellow of the honey, in order that</p>
<p>The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled</p>
<p>As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down</p>
<p>The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,</p>
<p>Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus</p>
<p>Grow strong again with recreated health:</p>
<p>So now I too (since this my doctrine seems</p>
<p>In general somewhat woeful unto those</p>
<p>Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd</p>
<p>Starts back from it in horror) have desired</p>
<p>To expound our doctrine unto thee in song</p>
<p>Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,</p>
<p>To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse-</p>
<p>If by such method haply I might hold</p>
<p>The mind of thee upon these lines of ours,</p>
<p>Till thou see through the nature of all things,</p>
<p>And how exists the interwoven frame.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="951"/>
<p rend="indent">  But since I've taught that bodies of matter, made</p>
<p>Completely solid, hither and thither fly</p>
<p>Forevermore unconquered through all time,</p>
<p>Now come, and whether to the sum of them</p>
<p>There be a limit or be none, for thee</p>
<p>Let us unfold; likewise what has been found</p>
<p>To be the wide inane, or room, or space</p>
<p>Wherein all things soever do go on,</p>
<p>Let us examine if it finite be</p>
<p>All and entire, or reach unmeasured round</p>
<p>And downward an illimitable profound.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Thus, then, the All that is is limited</p>
<p>In no one region of its onward paths,</p>
<p>For then 'tmust have forever its beyond.</p>
<p>And a beyond 'tis seen can never be</p>
<p>For aught, unless still further on there be</p>
<p>A somewhat somewhere that may bound the same-</p>
<p>So that the thing be seen still on to where</p>
<p>The nature of sensation of that thing</p>
<p>Can follow it no longer. Now because</p>
<p>Confess we must there's naught beside the sum,</p>
<p>There's no beyond, and so it lacks all end.</p>
<p>It matters nothing where thou post thyself,</p>
<p>In whatsoever regions of the same;</p>
<p>Even any place a man has set him down</p>
<p>Still leaves about him the unbounded all</p>
<p>Outward in all directions; or, supposing</p>
<p>A moment the all of space finite to be,</p>
<p>If some one farthest traveller runs forth</p>
<p>Unto the extreme coasts and throws ahead</p>
<p>A flying spear, is't then thy wish to think</p>
<p>It goes, hurled off amain, to where 'twas sent</p>
<p>And shoots afar, or that some object there</p>
<p>Can thwart and stop it? For the one or other</p>
<p>Thou must admit and take. Either of which</p>
<p>Shuts off escape for thee, and does compel</p>
<p>That thou concede the all spreads everywhere,</p>
<p>Owning no confines. Since whether there be</p>
<p>Aught that may block and check it so it comes</p>
<p>Not where 'twas sent, nor lodges in its goal,</p>
<p>Or whether borne along, in either view</p>
<p>'Thas started not from any end. And so</p>
<p>I'll follow on, and whereso'er thou set</p>
<p>The extreme coasts, I'll query, "what becomes</p>
<p>Thereafter of thy spear?" 'Twill come to pass</p>
<p>That nowhere can a world's-end be, and that</p>
<p>The chance for further flight prolongs forever</p>
<p>The flight itself. Besides, were all the space</p>
<p>Of the totality and sum shut in</p>
<p>With fixed coasts, and bounded everywhere,</p>
<p>Then would the abundance of world's matter flow</p>
<p>Together by solid weight from everywhere</p>
<p>Still downward to the bottom of the world,</p>
<p>Nor aught could happen under cope of sky,</p>
<p>Nor could there be a sky at all or sun-</p>
<p>Indeed, where matter all one heap would lie,</p>
<p>By having settled during infinite time.</p>
<p>But in reality, repose is given</p>
<p>Unto no bodies 'mongst the elements,</p>
<p>Because there is no bottom whereunto</p>
<p>They might, as 'twere, together flow, and where</p>
<p>They might take up their undisturbed abodes.</p>
<p>In endless motion everything goes on</p>
<p>Forevermore; out of all regions, even</p>
<p>Out of the pit below, from forth the vast,</p>
<p>Are hurtled bodies evermore supplied.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1002"/>
<p>The nature of room, the space of the abyss</p>
<p>Is such that even the flashing thunderbolts</p>
<p>Can neither speed upon their courses through,</p>
<p>Gliding across eternal tracts of time,</p>
<p>Nor, further, bring to pass, as on they run,</p>
<p>That they may bate their journeying one whit:</p>
<p>Such huge abundance spreads for things around-</p>
<p>Room off to every quarter, without end.</p>
<p>Lastly, before our very eyes is seen</p>
<p>Thing to bound thing: air hedges hill from hill,</p>
<p>And mountain walls hedge air; land ends the sea,</p>
<p>And sea in turn all lands; but for the All</p>
<p>Truly is nothing which outside may bound.</p>
<p>That, too, the sum of things itself may not</p>
<p>Have power to fix a measure of its own,</p>
<p>Great nature guards, she who compels the void</p>
<p>To bound all body, as body all the void,</p>
<p>Thus rendering by these alternates the whole</p>
<p>An infinite; or else the one or other,</p>
<p>Being unbounded by the other, spreads,</p>
<p>Even by its single nature, ne'ertheless</p>
<p>Immeasurably forth....</p>
<p>Nor sea, nor earth, nor shining vaults of sky,</p>
<p>Nor breed of mortals, nor holy limbs of gods</p>
<p>Could keep their place least portion of an hour:</p>
<p>For, driven apart from out its meetings fit,</p>
<p>The stock of stuff, dissolved, would be borne</p>
<p>Along the illimitable inane afar,</p>
<p>Or rather, in fact, would ne'er have once combined</p>
<p>And given a birth to aught, since, scattered wide,</p>
<p>It could not be united. For of truth</p>
<p>Neither by counsel did the primal germs</p>
<p>'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,</p>
<p>Each in its proper place; nor did they make,</p>
<p>Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move;</p>
<p>But since, being many and changed in many modes</p>
<p>Along the All, they're driven abroad and vexed</p>
<p>By blow on blow, even from all time of old,</p>
<p>They thus at last, after attempting all</p>
<p>The kinds of motion and conjoining, come</p>
<p>Into those great arrangements out of which</p>
<p>This sum of things established is create,</p>
<p>By which, moreover, through the mighty years,</p>
<p>It is preserved, when once it has been thrown</p>
<p>Into the proper motions, bringing to pass</p>
<p>That ever the streams refresh the greedy main</p>
<p>With river-waves abounding, and that earth,</p>
<p>Lapped in warm exhalations of the sun,</p>
<p>Renews her broods, and that the lusty race</p>
<p>Of breathing creatures bears and blooms, and that</p>
<p>The gliding fires of ether are alive-</p>
<p>What still the primal germs nowise could do,</p>
<p>Unless from out the infinite of space</p>
<p>Could come supply of matter, whence in season</p>
<p>They're wont whatever losses to repair.</p>
<p>For as the nature of breathing creatures wastes,</p>
<p>Losing its body, when deprived of food:</p>
<p>So all things have to be dissolved as soon</p>
<p>As matter, diverted by what means soever</p>
<p>From off its course, shall fail to be on hand.</p>
<p>Nor can the blows from outward still conserve,</p>
<p>On every side, whatever sum of a world</p>
<p>Has been united in a whole. They can</p>
<p>Indeed, by frequent beating, check a part,</p>
<p>Till others arriving may fulfil the sum;</p>
<p>But meanwhile often are they forced to spring</p>
<p>Rebounding back, and, as they spring, to yield,</p>
<p>Unto those elements whence a world derives,</p>
<p>Room and a time for flight, permitting them</p>
<p>To be from off the massy union borne</p>
<p>Free and afar. Wherefore, again, again:</p>
<p>Needs must there come a many for supply;</p>
<p>And also, that the blows themselves shall be</p>
<p>Unfailing ever, must there ever be</p>
<p>An infinite force of matter all sides round.</p>

<p>Nor gleam with silver, and to the lyre resound</p>
<p>No fretted and gilded ceilings overhead,</p>
<p>Yet still to lounge with friends in the soft grass</p>
<p>Beside a river of water, underneath</p>
<p>A big tree's boughs, and merrily to refresh</p>
<p>Our frames, with no vast outlay- most of all</p>
<p>If the weather is laughing and the times of the year</p>
<p>Besprinkle the green of the grass around with flowers.</p>
<p>Nor yet the quicker will hot fevers go,</p>
<p>If on a pictured tapestry thou toss,</p>
<p>Or purple robe, than if 'tis thine to lie</p>
<p>Upon the poor man's bedding. Wherefore, since</p>
<p>Treasure, nor rank, nor glory of a reign</p>
<p>Avail us naught for this our body, thus</p>
<p>Reckon them likewise nothing for the mind:</p>
<p>Save then perchance, when thou beholdest forth</p>
<p>Thy legions swarming round the Field of Mars,</p>
<p>Rousing a mimic warfare- either side</p>
<p>Strengthened with large auxiliaries and horse,</p>
<p>Alike equipped with arms, alike inspired;</p>
<p>Or save when also thou beholdest forth</p>
<p>Thy fleets to swarm, deploying down the sea:</p>
<p>For then, by such bright circumstance abashed,</p>
<p>Religion pales and flees thy mind; O then</p>
<p>The fears of death leave heart so free of care.</p>
<p>But if we note how all this pomp at last</p>
<p>Is but a drollery and a mocking sport,</p>
<p>And of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels,</p>
<p>Dreads not these sounds of arms, these savage swords</p>
<p>But among kings and lords of all the world</p>
<p>Mingles undaunted, nor is overawed</p>
<p>By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright</p>
<p>Of purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this</p>
<p>Is aught, but power of thinking?- when, besides</p>
<p>The whole of life but labours in the dark.</p>
<p>For just as children tremble and fear all</p>
<p>In the viewless dark, so even we at times</p>
<p>Dread in the light so many things that be</p>
<p>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</p>
<p>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</p>
<p>This terror then, this darkness of the mind,</p>
<p>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</p>
<p>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</p>
<p>But only nature's aspect and her law.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Now come: I will untangle for thy steps</p>
<p>Now by what motions the begetting bodies</p>
<p>Of the world-stuff beget the varied world,</p>
<p>And then forever resolve it when begot,</p>
<p>And by what force they are constrained to this,</p>
<p>And what the speed appointed unto them</p>
<p>Wherewith to travel down the vast inane:</p>
<p>Do thou remember to yield thee to my words.</p>
<p>For truly matter coheres not, crowds not tight,</p>
<p>Since we behold each thing to wane away,</p>
<p>And we observe how all flows on and off,</p>
<p>As 'twere, with age-old time, and from our eyes</p>
<p>How eld withdraws each object at the end,</p>
<p>Albeit the sum is seen to bide the same,</p>
<p>Unharmed, because these motes that leave each thing</p>
<p>Diminish what they part from, but endow</p>
<p>With increase those to which in turn they come,</p>
<p>Constraining these to wither in old age,</p>
<p>And those to flower at the prime (and yet</p>
<p>Biding not long among them). Thus the sum</p>
<p>Forever is replenished, and we live</p>
<p>As mortals by eternal give and take.</p>
<p>The nations wax, the nations wane away;</p>
<p>In a brief space the generations pass,</p>
<p>And like to runners hand the lamp of life</p>
<p>One unto other.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="80"/>
<p rend="indent">                       But if thou believe</p>
<p>That the primordial germs of things can stop,</p>
<p>And in their stopping give new motions birth,</p>
<p>Afar thou wanderest from the road of truth.</p>
<p>For since they wander through the void inane,</p>
<p>All the primordial germs of things must needs</p>
<p>Be borne along, either by weight their own,</p>
<p>Or haply by another's blow without.</p>
<p>For, when, in their incessancy so oft</p>
<p>They meet and clash, it comes to pass amain</p>
<p>They leap asunder, face to face: not strange-</p>
<p>Being most hard, and solid in their weights,</p>
<p>And naught opposing motion, from behind.</p>
<p>And that more clearly thou perceive how all</p>
<p>These mites of matter are darted round about,</p>
<p>Recall to mind how nowhere in the sum</p>
<p>Of All exists a bottom,- nowhere is</p>
<p>A realm of rest for primal bodies; since</p>
<p>(As amply shown and proved by reason sure)</p>
<p>Space has no bound nor measure, and extends</p>
<p>Unmetered forth in all directions round.</p>
<p>Since this stands certain, thus 'tis out of doubt</p>
<p>No rest is rendered to the primal bodies</p>
<p>Along the unfathomable inane; but rather,</p>
<p>Inveterately plied by motions mixed,</p>
<p>Some, at their jamming, bound aback and leave</p>
<p>Huge gaps between, and some from off the blow</p>
<p>Are hurried about with spaces small between.</p>
<p>And all which, brought together with slight gaps,</p>
<p>In more condensed union bound aback,</p>
<p>Linked by their own all inter-tangled shapes,-</p>
<p>These form the irrefragable roots of rocks</p>
<p>And the brute bulks of iron, and what else</p>
<p>Is of their kind...</p>
<p>The rest leap far asunder, far recoil,</p>
<p>Leaving huge gaps between: and these supply</p>
<p>For us thin air and splendour-lights of the sun.</p>
<p>And many besides wander the mighty void-</p>
<p>Cast back from unions of existing things,</p>
<p>Nowhere accepted in the universe,</p>
<p>And nowise linked in motions to the rest.</p>
<p>And of this fact (as I record it here)</p>
<p>An image, a type goes on before our eyes</p>
<p>Present each moment; for behold whenever</p>
<p>The sun's light and the rays, let in, pour down</p>
<p>Across dark halls of houses: thou wilt see</p>
<p>The many mites in many a manner mixed</p>
<p>Amid a void in the very light of the rays,</p>
<p>And battling on, as in eternal strife,</p>
<p>And in battalions contending without halt,</p>
<p>In meetings, partings, harried up and down.</p>
<p>From this thou mayest conjecture of what sort</p>
<p>The ceaseless tossing of primordial seeds</p>
<p>Amid the mightier void- at least so far</p>
<p>As small affair can for a vaster serve,</p>
<p>And by example put thee on the spoor</p>
<p>Of knowledge. For this reason too 'tis fit</p>
<p>Thou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies</p>
<p>Which here are witnessed tumbling in the light:</p>
<p>Namely, because such tumblings are a sign</p>
<p>That motions also of the primal stuff</p>
<p>Secret and viewless lurk beneath, behind.</p>
<p>For thou wilt mark here many a speck, impelled</p>
<p>By viewless blows, to change its little course,</p>
<p>And beaten backwards to return again,</p>
<p>Hither and thither in all directions round.</p>
<p>Lo, all their shifting movement is of old,</p>
<p>From the primeval atoms; for the same</p>
<p>Primordial seeds of things first move of self,</p>
<p>And then those bodies built of unions small</p>
<p>And nearest, as it were, unto the powers</p>
<p>Of the primeval atoms, are stirred up</p>
<p>By impulse of those atoms' unseen blows,</p>
<p>And these thereafter goad the next in size:</p>
<p>Thus motion ascends from the primevals on,</p>
<p>And stage by stage emerges to our sense,</p>
<p>Until those objects also move which we</p>
<p>Can mark in sunbeams, though it not appears</p>
<p>What blows do urge them.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="142"/>
<p rend="indent">   Now what the speed to matter's atoms given</p>
<p>Thou mayest in few, my Memmius, learn from this:</p>
<p>When first the dawn is sprinkling with new light</p>
<p>The lands, and all the breed of birds abroad</p>
<p>Flit round the trackless forests, with liquid notes</p>
<p>Filling the regions along the mellow air,</p>
<p>We see 'tis forthwith manifest to man</p>
<p>How suddenly the risen sun is wont</p>
<p>At such an hour to overspread and clothe</p>
<p>The whole with its own splendour; but the sun's</p>
<p>Warm exhalations and this serene light</p>
<p>Travel not down an empty void; and thus</p>
<p>They are compelled more slowly to advance,</p>
<p>Whilst, as it were, they cleave the waves of air;</p>
<p>Nor one by one travel these particles</p>
<p>Of the warm exhalations, but are all</p>
<p>Entangled and enmassed, whereby at once</p>
<p>Each is restrained by each, and from without</p>
<p>Checked, till compelled more slowly to advance.</p>
<p>But the primordial atoms with their old</p>
<p>Simple solidity, when forth they travel</p>
<p>Along the empty void, all undelayed</p>
<p>By aught outside them there, and they, each one</p>
<p>Being one unit from nature of its parts,</p>
<p>Are borne to that one place on which they strive</p>
<p>Still to lay hold, must then, beyond a doubt,</p>
<p>Outstrip in speed, and be more swiftly borne</p>
<p>Than light of sun, and over regions rush,</p>
<p>Of space much vaster, in the self-same time</p>
<p>The sun's effulgence widens round the sky.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Nor to pursue the atoms one by one,</p>
<p>To see the law whereby each thing goes on.</p>
<p>But some men, ignorant of matter, think,</p>
<p>Opposing this, that not without the gods,</p>
<p>In such adjustment to our human ways,</p>
<p>Can nature change the seasons of the years,</p>
<p>And bring to birth the grains and all of else</p>
<p>To which divine Delight, the guide of life,</p>
<p>Persuades mortality and leads it on,</p>
<p>That, through her artful blandishments of love,</p>
<p>It propagate the generations still,</p>
<p>Lest humankind should perish. When they feign</p>
<p>That gods have stablished all things but for man,</p>
<p>They seem in all ways mightily to lapse</p>
<p>From reason's truth: for ev'n if ne'er I knew</p>
<p>What seeds primordial are, yet would I dare</p>
<p>This to affirm, ev'n from deep judgment based</p>
<p>Upon the ways and conduct of the skies-</p>
<p>This to maintain by many a fact besides-</p>
<p>That in no wise the nature of the world</p>
<p>For us was builded by a power divine-</p>
<p>So great the faults it stands encumbered with:</p>
<p>The which, my Memmius, later on, for thee</p>
<p>We will clear up. Now as to what remains</p>
<p>Concerning motions we'll unfold our thought.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="184"/>
<p rend="indent">  Now is the place, meseems, in these affairs</p>
<p>To prove for thee this too: nothing corporeal</p>
<p>Of its own force can e'er be upward borne,</p>
<p>Or upward go- nor let the bodies of flames</p>
<p>Deceive thee here: for they engendered are</p>
<p>With urge to upwards, taking thus increase,</p>
<p>Whereby grow upwards shining grains and trees,</p>
<p>Though all the weight within them downward bears.</p>
<p>Nor, when the fires will leap from under round</p>
<p>The roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up</p>
<p>Timber and beam, 'tis then to be supposed</p>
<p>They act of own accord, no force beneath</p>
<p>To urge them up. 'Tis thus that blood, discharged</p>
<p>From out our bodies, spurts its jets aloft</p>
<p>And spatters gore. And hast thou never marked</p>
<p>With what a force the water will disgorge</p>
<p>Timber and beam? The deeper, straight and down,</p>
<p>We push them in, and, many though we be,</p>
<p>The more we press with main and toil, the more</p>
<p>The water vomits up and flings them back,</p>
<p>That, more than half their length, they there emerge,</p>
<p>Rebounding. Yet we never doubt, meseems,</p>
<p>That all the weight within them downward bears</p>
<p>Through empty void. Well, in like manner, flames</p>
<p>Ought also to be able, when pressed out,</p>
<p>Through winds of air to rise aloft, even though</p>
<p>The weight within them strive to draw them down.</p>
<p>Hast thou not seen, sweeping so far and high,</p>
<p>The meteors, midnight flambeaus of the sky,</p>
<p>How after them they draw long trails of flame</p>
<p>Wherever Nature gives a thoroughfare?</p>
<p>How stars and constellations drop to earth,</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> not? Nay, too, the sun from peak of heaven</p>
<p>Sheds round to every quarter its large heat,</p>
<p>And sows the new-ploughed intervales with light:</p>
<p>Thus also sun's heat downward tends to earth.</p>
<p>Athwart the rain thou seest the lightning fly;</p>
<p>Now here, now there, bursting from out the clouds,</p>
<p>The fires dash zig-zag- and that flaming power</p>
<p>Falls likewise down to earth.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="216"/>
<p rend="indent">                              In these affairs</p>
<p>We wish thee also well aware of this:</p>
<p>The atoms, as their own weight bears them down</p>
<p>Plumb through the void, at scarce determined times,</p>
<p>In scarce determined places, from their course</p>
<p>Decline a little- call it, so to speak,</p>
<p>Mere changed trend. For were it not their wont</p>
<p>Thuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one,</p>
<p>Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void;</p>
<p>And then collisions ne'er could be nor blows</p>
<p>Among the primal elements; and thus</p>
<p>Nature would never have created aught.</p>
<p rend="indent">  But, if perchance be any that believe</p>
<p>The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne</p>
<p>Plumb down the void, are able from above</p>
<p>To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows</p>
<p>Able to cause those procreant motions, far</p>
<p>From highways of true reason they retire.</p>
<p>For whatsoever through the waters fall,</p>
<p>Or through thin air, must quicken their descent,</p>
<p>Each after its weight- on this account, because</p>
<p>Both bulk of water and the subtle air</p>
<p>By no means can retard each thing alike,</p>
<p>But give more quick before the heavier weight;</p>
<p>But contrariwise the empty void cannot,</p>
<p>On any side, at any time, to aught</p>
<p>Oppose resistance, but will ever yield,</p>
<p>True to its bent of nature. Wherefore all,</p>
<p>With equal speed, though equal not in weight,</p>
<p>Must rush, borne downward through the still inane.</p>
<p>Thus ne'er at all have heavier from above</p>
<p>Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes</p>
<p>Which cause those divers motions, by whose means</p>
<p>Nature transacts her work. And so I say,</p>
<p>The atoms must a little swerve at times-</p>
<p>But only the least, lest we should seem to feign</p>
<p>Motions oblique, and fact refute us there.</p>
<p>For this we see forthwith is manifest:</p>
<p>Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely go,</p>
<p>Down on its headlong journey from above,</p>
<p>At least so far as thou canst mark; but who</p>
<p>Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve</p>
<p>At all aside from off its road's straight line?</p>
<p rend="indent">  Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked,</p>
<p>And from the old ever arise the new</p>
<p>In fixed order, and primordial seeds</p>
<p>Produce not by their swerving some new start</p>
<p>Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate,</p>
<p>That cause succeed not cause from everlasting,</p>
<p>Whence this free will for creatures o'er the lands,</p>
<p>Whence is it wrested from the fates,- this will</p>
<p>Whereby we step right forward where desire</p>
<p>Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve</p>
<p>In motions, not as at some fixed time,</p>
<p>Nor at some fixed line of space, but where</p>
<p>The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt</p>
<p>In these affairs 'tis each man's will itself</p>
<p>That gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs</p>
<p>Incipient motions are diffused. Again,</p>
<p>Dost thou not see, when, at a point of time,</p>
<p>The bars are opened, how the eager strength</p>
<p>Of horses cannot forward break as soon</p>
<p>As pants their mind to do? For it behooves</p>
<p>That all the stock of matter, through the frame,</p>
<p>Be roused, in order that, through every joint,</p>
<p>Aroused, it press and follow mind's desire;</p>
<p>So thus thou seest initial motion's gendered</p>
<p>From out the heart, aye, verily, proceeds</p>
<p>First from the spirit's will, whence at the last</p>
<p>'Tis given forth through joints and body entire.</p>
<p>Quite otherwise it is, when forth we move,</p>
<p>Impelled by a blow of another's mighty powers</p>
<p>And mighty urge; for then 'tis clear enough</p>
<p>All matter of our total body goes,</p>
<p>Hurried along, against our own desire-</p>
<p>Until the will has pulled upon the reins</p>
<p>And checked it back, throughout our members all;</p>
<p>At whose arbitrament indeed sometimes</p>
<p>The stock of matter's forced to change its path,</p>
<p>Throughout our members and throughout our joints,</p>
<p>And, after being forward cast, to be</p>
<p>Reined up, whereat it settles back again.</p>
<p>So seest thou not, how, though external force</p>
<p>Drive men before, and often make them move,</p>
<p>Onward against desire, and headlong snatched,</p>
<p>Yet is there something in these breasts of ours</p>
<p>Strong to combat, strong to withstand the same?-</p>
<p>Wherefore no less within the primal seeds</p>
<p>Thou must admit, besides all blows and weight,</p>
<p>Some other cause of motion, whence derives</p>
<p>This power in us inborn, of some free act.-</p>
<p>Since naught from nothing can become, we see.</p>
<p>For weight prevents all things should come to pass</p>
<p>Through blows, as 'twere, by some external force;</p>
<p>But that man's mind itself in all it does</p>
<p>Hath not a fixed necessity within,</p>
<p>Nor is not, like a conquered thing, compelled</p>
<p>To bear and suffer,- this state comes to man</p>
<p>From that slight swervement of the elements</p>
<p>In no fixed line of space, in no fixed time.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="294"/>
<p rend="indent">  Nor ever was the stock of stuff more crammed,</p>
<p>Nor ever, again, sundered by bigger gaps:</p>
<p>For naught gives increase and naught takes away;</p>
<p>On which account, just as they move to-day,</p>
<p>The elemental bodies moved of old</p>
<p>And shall the same hereafter evermore.</p>
<p>And what was wont to be begot of old</p>
<p>Shall be begotten under selfsame terms</p>
<p>And grow and thrive in power, so far as given</p>
<p>To each by Nature's changeless, old decrees.</p>
<p>The sum of things there is no power can change,</p>
<p>For naught exists outside, to which can flee</p>
<p>Out of the world matter of any kind,</p>
<p>Nor forth from which a fresh supply can spring,</p>
<p>Break in upon the founded world, and change</p>
<p>Whole nature of things, and turn their motions about.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="308" />
<p rend="indent">                          Herein wonder not</p>
<p>How 'tis that, while the seeds of things are all</p>
<p>Moving forever, the sum yet seems to stand</p>
<p>Supremely still, except in cases where</p>
<p>A thing shows motion of its frame as whole.</p>
<p>For far beneath the ken of senses lies</p>
<p>The nature of those ultimates of the world;</p>
<p>And so, since those themselves thou canst not see,</p>
<p>Their motion also must they veil from men-</p>
<p>For mark, indeed, how things we can see, oft</p>
<p>Yet hide their motions, when afar from us</p>
<p>Along the distant landscape. Often thus,</p>
<p>Upon a hillside will the woolly flocks</p>
<p>Be cropping their goodly food and creeping about</p>
<p>Whither the summons of the grass, begemmed</p>
<p>With the fresh dew, is calling, and the lambs,</p>
<p>Well filled, are frisking, locking horns in sport:</p>
<p>Yet all for us seem blurred and blent afar-</p>
<p>A glint of white at rest on a green hill.</p>
<p>Again, when mighty legions, marching round,</p>
<p>Fill all the quarters of the plains below,</p>
<p>Rousing a mimic warfare, there the sheen</p>
<p>Shoots up the sky, and all the fields about</p>
<p>Glitter with brass, and from beneath, a sound</p>
<p>Goes forth from feet of stalwart soldiery,</p>
<p>And mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send</p>
<p>The voices onward to the stars of heaven,</p>
<p>And hither and thither darts the cavalry,</p>
<p>And of a sudden down the midmost fields</p>
<p>Charges with onset stout enough to rock</p>
<p>The solid earth: and yet some post there is</p>
<p>Up the high mountains, viewed from which they seem</p>
<p>To stand- a gleam at rest along the plains.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Now come, and next hereafter apprehend</p>

<p>These old beginnings of the universe;</p>
<p>Not in the sense that only few are furnished</p>
<p>With one like form, but rather not at all</p>
<p>In general have they likeness each with each,</p>
<p>No marvel: since the stock of them's so great</p>
<p>That there's no end (as I have taught) nor sum,</p>

<p>And all the breeds of birds- both those that teem</p>
<p>In gladsome regions of the water-haunts,</p>
<p>About the river-banks and springs and pools,</p>
<p>And those that throng, flitting from tree to tree,</p>
<p>Through trackless woods- Go, take which one thou wilt,</p>
<p>In any kind: thou wilt discover still</p>
<p>Each from the other still unlike in shape.</p>
<p>Nor in no other wise could offspring know</p>
<p>Mother, nor mother offspring- which we see</p>
<p>They yet can do, distinguished one from other,</p>
<p>No less than human beings, by clear signs.</p>
<p>Thus oft before fair temples of the gods,</p>
<p>Beside the incense-burning altars slain,</p>
<p>Drops down the yearling calf, from out its breast</p>
<p>Breathing warm streams of blood; the orphaned mother,</p>
<p>Ranging meanwhile green woodland pastures round,</p>
<p>Knows well the footprints, pressed by cloven hoofs,</p>
<p>With eyes regarding every spot about,</p>
<p>For sight somewhere of youngling gone from her;</p>
<p>And, stopping short, filleth the leafy lanes</p>
<p>With her complaints; and oft she seeks again</p>
<p>Within the stall, pierced by her yearning still.</p>
<p>Nor tender willows, nor dew-quickened grass,</p>
<p>Nor the loved streams that glide along low banks,</p>
<p>Can lure her mind and turn the sudden pain;</p>
<p>Nor other shapes of calves that graze thereby</p>
<p>Distract her mind or lighten pain the least-</p>
<p>So keen her search for something known and hers.</p>
<p>Moreover, tender kids with bleating throats</p>
<p>Do know their horned dams, and butting lambs</p>
<p>The flocks of sheep, and thus they patter on,</p>
<p>Unfailingly each to its proper teat,</p>
<p>As nature intends. Lastly, with any grain,</p>
<p>Thou'lt see that no one kernel in one kind</p>
<p>Is so far like another, that there still</p>
<p>Is not in shapes some difference running through.</p>
<p>By a like law we see how earth is pied</p>
<p>With shells and conchs, where, with soft waves, the sea</p>
<p>Beats on the thirsty sands of curving shores.</p>
<p>Wherefore again, again, since seeds of things</p>
<p>Exist by nature, nor were wrought with hands</p>
<p>After a fixed pattern of one other,</p>

<p>Than these of ours from pitch-pine born on earth.</p>
<p>For thou canst say lightning's celestial fire,</p>
<p>So subtle, is formed of figures finer far,</p>
<p>And passes thus through holes which this our fire,</p>
<p>Born from the wood, created from the pine,</p>
<p>Cannot. Again, light passes through the horn</p>
<p>On the lantern's side, while rain is dashed away.</p>
<p>And why?- unless those bodies of light should be</p>
<p>Finer than those of water's genial showers.</p>
<p>We see how quickly through a colander</p>
<p>The wines will flow; how, on the other hand,</p>
<p>The sluggish olive-oil delays: no doubt,</p>
<p>Because 'tis wrought of elements more large,</p>
<p>Or else more crook'd and intertangled. Thus</p>
<p>It comes that the primordials cannot be</p>
<p>So suddenly sundered one from other, and seep,</p>
<p>One through each several hole of anything.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="398"/>
<p rend="indent">  And note, besides, that liquor of honey or milk</p>
<p>Yields in the mouth agreeable taste to tongue,</p>
<p>Whilst nauseous wormwood, pungent centaury,</p>
<p>With their foul flavour set the lips awry;</p>
<p>Thus simple 'tis to see that whatsoever</p>
<p>Can touch the senses pleasingly are made</p>
<p>Of smooth and rounded elements, whilst those</p>
<p>Which seem the bitter and the sharp, are held</p>
<p>Entwined by elements more crook'd, and so</p>
<p>Are wont to tear their ways into our senses,</p>
<p>And rend our body as they enter in.</p>
<p>In short all good to sense, all bad to touch,</p>
<p>Being up-built of figures so unlike,</p>
<p>Are mutually at strife- lest thou suppose</p>
<p>That the shrill rasping of a squeaking saw</p>
<p>Consists of elements as smooth as song</p>
<p>Which, waked by nimble fingers, on the strings</p>
<p>The sweet musicians fashion; or suppose</p>
<p>That same-shaped atoms through men's nostrils pierce</p>
<p>When foul cadavers burn, as when the stage</p>
<p>Is with Cilician saffron sprinkled fresh,</p>
<p>And the altar near exhales Panchaean scent;</p>
<p>Or hold as of like seed the goodly hues</p>
<p>Of things which feast our eyes, as those which sting</p>
<p>Against the smarting pupil and draw tears,</p>
<p>Or show, with gruesome aspect, grim and vile.</p>
<p>For never a shape which charms our sense was made</p>
<p>Without some elemental smoothness; whilst</p>
<p>Whate'er is harsh and irksome has been framed</p>
<p>Still with some roughness in its elements.</p>
<p>Some, too, there are which justly are supposed</p>
<p>To be nor smooth nor altogether hooked,</p>
<p>With bended barbs, but slightly angled-out,</p>
<p>To tickle rather than to wound the sense-</p>
<p>And of which sort is the salt tartar of wine</p>
<p>And flavours of the gummed elecampane.</p>
<p>Again, that glowing fire and icy rime</p>
<p>Are fanged with teeth unlike whereby to sting</p>
<p>Our body's sense, the touch of each gives proof.</p>
<p>For touch- by sacred majesties of Gods!-</p>
<p>Touch is indeed the body's only sense-</p>
<p>Be't that something in-from-outward works,</p>
<p>Be't that something in the body born</p>
<p>Wounds, or delighteth as it passes out</p>
<p>Along the procreant paths of Aphrodite;</p>
<p>Or be't the seeds by some collision whirl</p>
<p>Disordered in the body and confound</p>
<p>By tumult and confusion all the sense-</p>
<p>As thou mayst find, if haply with the hand</p>
<p>Thyself thou strike thy body's any part.</p>
<p>On which account, the elemental forms</p>
<p>Must differ widely, as enabled thus</p>
<p>To cause diverse sensations.</p>
<p rend="indent">                             And, again,</p>
<p>What seems to us the hardened and condensed</p>
<p>Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked,</p>
<p>Be held compacted deep within, as 'twere</p>
<p>By branch-like atoms- of which sort the chief</p>
<p>Are diamond stones, despisers of all blows,</p>
<p>And stalwart flint and strength of solid iron,</p>
<p>And brazen bars, which, budging hard in locks,</p>
<p>Do grate and scream. But what are liquid, formed</p>
<p>Of fluid body, they indeed must be</p>
<p>Of elements more smooth and round- because</p>
<p>Their globules severally will not cohere:</p>
<p>To suck the poppy-seeds from palm of hand</p>
<p>Is quite as easy as drinking water down,</p>
<p>And they, once struck, roll like unto the same.</p>
<p>But that thou seest among the things that flow</p>
<p>Some bitter, as the brine of ocean is,</p>
<p>Is not the least a marvel...</p>
<p>For since 'tis fluid, smooth its atoms are</p>
<p>And round, with painful rough ones mixed therein;</p>
<p>Yet need not these be held together hooked:</p>
<p>In fact, though rough, they're globular besides,</p>
<p>Able at once to roll, and rasp the sense.</p>
<p>And that the more thou mayst believe me here,</p>
<p>That with smooth elements are mixed the rough</p>
<p>(Whence Neptune's salt astringent body comes),</p>
<p>There is a means to separate the twain,</p>
<p>And thereupon dividedly to see</p>
<p>How the sweet water, after filtering through</p>
<p>So often underground, flows freshened forth</p>
<p>Into some hollow; for it leaves above</p>
<p>The primal germs of nauseating brine,</p>
<p>Since cling the rough more readily in earth.</p>
<p>Lastly, whatso thou markest to disperse</p>
<p>Upon the instant- smoke, and cloud, and flame-</p>
<p>Must not (even though not all of smooth and round)</p>
<p>Be yet co-linked with atoms intertwined,</p>
<p>That thus they can, without together cleaving,</p>
<p>So pierce our body and so bore the rocks.</p>
<p>Whatever we see...</p>
<p>Given to senses, that thou must perceive</p>
<p>They're not from linked but pointed elements.</p>

<p rend="indent">  The which now having taught, I will go on</p>
<p>To bind thereto a fact to this allied</p>
<p>And drawing from this its proof: these primal germs</p>
<p>Vary, yet only with finite tale of shapes.</p>
<p>For were these shapes quite infinite, some seeds</p>
<p>Would have a body of infinite increase.</p>
<p>For in one seed, in one small frame of any,</p>
<p>The shapes can't vary from one another much.</p>
<p>Assume, we'll say, that of three minim parts</p>
<p>Consist the primal bodies, or add a few:</p>
<p>When, now, by placing all these parts of one</p>
<p>At top and bottom, changing lefts and rights,</p>
<p>Thou hast with every kind of shift found out</p>
<p>What the aspect of shape of its whole body</p>
<p>Each new arrangement gives, for what remains,</p>
<p>If thou percase wouldst vary its old shapes,</p>
<p>New parts must then be added; follows next,</p>
<p>If thou percase wouldst vary still its shapes,</p>
<p>That by like logic each arrangement still</p>
<p>Requires its increment of other parts.</p>
<p>Ergo, an augmentation of its frame</p>
<p>Follows upon each novelty of forms.</p>
<p>Wherefore, it cannot be thou'lt undertake</p>
<p>That seeds have infinite differences in form,</p>
<p>Lest thus thou forcest some indeed to be</p>
<p>Of an immeasurable immensity-</p>
<p>Which I have taught above cannot be proved.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>And now for thee barbaric robes, and gleam</p>
<p>Of Meliboean purple, touched with dye</p>
<p>Of the Thessalian shell...</p>
<p>The peacock's golden generations, stained</p>
<p>With spotted gaieties, would lie o'erthrown</p>
<p>By some new colour of new things more bright;</p>
<p>The odour of myrrh and savours of honey despised;</p>
<p>The swan's old lyric, and Apollo's hymns,</p>
<p>Once modulated on the many chords,</p>
<p>Would likewise sink o'ermastered and be mute:</p>
<p>For, lo, a somewhat, finer than the rest,</p>
<p>Would be arising evermore. So, too,</p>
<p>Into some baser part might all retire,</p>
<p>Even as we said to better might they come:</p>
<p>For, lo, a somewhat, loathlier than the rest</p>
<p>To nostrils, ears, and eyes, and taste of tongue,</p>
<p>Would then, by reasoning reversed, be there.</p>
<p>Since 'tis not so, but unto things are given</p>
<p>Their fixed limitations which do bound</p>
<p>Their sum on either side, 'tmust be confessed</p>
<p>That matter, too, by finite tale of shapes</p>
<p>Does differ. Again, from earth's midsummer heats</p>
<p>Unto the icy hoar-frosts of the year</p>
<p>The forward path is fixed, and by like law</p>
<p>O'ertravelled backwards at the dawn of spring.</p>
<p>For each degree of hot, and each of cold,</p>
<p>And the half-warm, all filling up the sum</p>
<p>In due progression, lie, my Memmius, there</p>
<p>Betwixt the two extremes: the things create</p>
<p>Must differ, therefore, by a finite change,</p>
<p>Since at each end marked off they ever are</p>
<p>By fixed point- on one side plagued by flames</p>
<p>And on the other by congealing frosts.</p>

<p rend="indent">  The which now having taught, I will go on</p>
<p>To bind thereto a fact to this allied</p>
<p>And drawing from this its proof: those primal germs</p>
<p>Which have been fashioned all of one like shape</p>
<p>Are infinite in tale; for, since the forms</p>
<p>Themselves are finite in divergences,</p>
<p>Then those which are alike will have to be</p>
<p>Infinite, else the sum of stuff remains</p>
<p>A finite- what I've proved is not the fact,</p>
<p>Showing in verse how corpuscles of stuff,</p>
<p>From everlasting and to-day the same,</p>
<p>Uphold the sum of things, all sides around</p>
<p>By old succession of unending blows.</p>
<p>For though thou view'st some beasts to be more rare,</p>
<p>And mark'st in them a less prolific stock,</p>
<p>Yet in another region, in lands remote,</p>
<p>That kind abounding may make up the count;</p>
<p>Even as we mark among the four-foot kind</p>
<p>Snake-handed elephants, whose thousands wall</p>

<p>Such few examples. Or suppose, besides,</p>
<p>We feign some thing, one of its kind and sole</p>
<p>With body born, to which is nothing like</p>
<p>In all the lands: yet now unless shall be</p>
<p>An infinite count of matter out of which</p>
<p>Thus to conceive and bring it forth to life,</p>
<p>It cannot be created and- what's more-</p>
<p>It cannot take its food and get increase.</p>
<p>Yea, if through all the world in finite tale</p>
<p>Be tossed the procreant bodies of one thing,</p>
<p>Whence, then, and where in what mode, by what power,</p>
<p>Shall they to meeting come together there,</p>
<p>In such vast ocean of matter and tumult strange?-</p>
<p>No means they have of joining into one.</p>
<p>But, just as, after mighty ship-wrecks piled,</p>
<p>The mighty main is wont to scatter wide</p>
<p>The rowers' banks, the ribs, the yards, the prow,</p>
<p>The masts and swimming oars, so that afar</p>
<p>Along all shores of lands are seen afloat</p>
<p>The carven fragments of the rended poop,</p>
<p>Giving a lesson to mortality</p>
<p>To shun the ambush of the faithless main,</p>
<p>The violence and the guile, and trust it not</p>
<p>At any hour, however much may smile</p>
<p>The crafty enticements of the placid deep:</p>
<p>Exactly thus, if once thou holdest true</p>
<p>That certain seeds are finite in their tale,</p>
<p>The various tides of matter, then, must needs</p>
<p>Scatter them flung throughout the ages all,</p>
<p>So that not ever can they join, as driven</p>
<p>Together into union, nor remain</p>
<p>In union, nor with increment can grow-</p>
<p>But facts in proof are manifest for each:</p>
<p>Things can be both begotten and increase.</p>
<p>'Tis therefore manifest that primal germs,</p>
<p>Are infinite in any class thou wilt-</p>
<p>From whence is furnished matter for all things.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Nor can those motions that bring death prevail</p>
<p>Forever, nor eternally entomb</p>
<p>The welfare of the world; nor, further, can</p>
<p>Those motions that give birth to things and growth</p>
<p>Keep them forever when created there.</p>
<p>Thus the long war, from everlasting waged,</p>
<p>With equal strife among the elements</p>
<p>Goes on and on. Now here, now there, prevail</p>
<p>The vital forces of the world- or fall.</p>
<p>Mixed with the funeral is the wildered wail</p>
<p>Of infants coming to the shores of light:</p>
<p>No night a day, no dawn a night hath followed</p>
<p>That heard not, mingling with the small birth-cries,</p>

<p>Resting on other earth. Unto her car</p>
<p>They've yoked the wild beasts, since a progeny,</p>
<p>However savage, must be tamed and chid</p>
<p>By care of parents. They have girt about</p>
<p>With turret-crown the summit of her head,</p>
<p>Since, fortressed in her goodly strongholds high,</p>
<p>'Tis she sustains the cities; now, adorned</p>
<p>With that same token, to-day is carried forth,</p>
<p>With solemn awe through many a mighty land,</p>
<p>The image of that mother, the divine.</p>
<p>Her the wide nations, after antique rite,</p>
<p>Do name Idaean Mother, giving her</p>
<p>Escort of Phrygian bands, since first, they say,</p>
<p>From out those regions 'twas that grain began</p>
<p>Through all the world. To her do they assign</p>
<p>The Galli, the emasculate, since thus</p>
<p>They wish to show that men who violate</p>
<p>The majesty of the mother and have proved</p>
<p>Ingrate to parents are to be adjudged</p>
<p>Unfit to give unto the shores of light</p>
<p>A living progeny. The Galli come:</p>
<p>And hollow cymbals, tight-skinned tambourines</p>
<p>Resound around to bangings of their hands;</p>
<p>The fierce horns threaten with a raucous bray;</p>
<p>The tubed pipe excites their maddened minds</p>
<p>In Phrygian measures; they bear before them knives,</p>
<p>Wild emblems of their frenzy, which have power</p>
<p>The rabble's ingrate heads and impious hearts</p>
<p>To panic with terror of the goddess' might.</p>
<p>And so, when through the mighty cities borne,</p>
<p>She blesses man with salutations mute,</p>
<p>They strew the highway of her journeyings</p>
<p>With coin of brass and silver, gifting her</p>
<p>With alms and largesse, and shower her and shade</p>
<p>With flowers of roses falling like the snow</p>
<p>Upon the Mother and her companion-bands.</p>
<p>Here is an armed troop, the which by Greeks</p>
<p>Are called the Phrygian Curetes. Since</p>
<p>Haply among themselves they use to play</p>
<p>In games of arms and leap in measure round</p>
<p>With bloody mirth and by their nodding shake</p>
<p>The terrorizing crests upon their heads,</p>
<p>This is the armed troop that represents</p>
<p>The arm'd Dictaean Curetes, who, in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>,</p>
<p>As runs the story, whilom did out-drown</p>
<p>That infant cry of Zeus, what time their band,</p>
<p>Young boys, in a swift dance around the boy,</p>
<p>To measured step beat with the brass on brass,</p>
<p>That Saturn might not get him for his jaws,</p>
<p>And give its mother an eternal wound</p>
<p>Along her heart. And 'tis on this account</p>
<p>That armed they escort the mighty Mother,</p>
<p>Or else because they signify by this</p>
<p>That she, the goddess, teaches men to be</p>
<p>Eager with armed valour to defend</p>
<p>Their motherland, and ready to stand forth,</p>
<p>The guard and glory of their parents' years.</p>
<p>A tale, however beautifully wrought,</p>
<p>That's wide of reason by a long remove:</p>
<p>For all the gods must of themselves enjoy</p>
<p>Immortal aeons and supreme repose,</p>
<p>Withdrawn from our affairs, detached, afar:</p>
<p>Immune from peril and immune from pain,</p>
<p>Themselves abounding in riches of their own,</p>
<p>Needing not us, they are not touched by wrath</p>
<p>They are not taken by service or by gift.</p>
<p>Truly is earth insensate for all time;</p>
<p>But, by obtaining germs of many things,</p>
<p>In many a way she brings the many forth</p>
<p>Into the light of sun. And here, whoso</p>
<p>Decides to call the ocean Neptune, or</p>
<p>The grain-crop <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>, and prefers to abuse</p>
<p>The name of Bacchus rather than pronounce</p>
<p>The liquor's proper designation, him</p>

<p rend="indent"> So, too, the wooly flocks, and horned kine,</p>
<p>And brood of battle-eager horses, grazing</p>
<p>Often together along one grassy plain,</p>
<p>Under the cope of one blue sky, and slaking</p>
<p>From out one stream of water each its thirst,</p>
<p>All live their lives with face and form unlike,</p>
<p>Keeping the parents' nature, parents' habits,</p>
<p>Which, kind by kind, through ages they repeat.</p>
<p>So great in any sort of herb thou wilt,</p>
<p>So great again in any river of earth</p>
<p>Are the distinct diversities of matter.</p>
<p>Hence, further, every creature- any one</p>
<p>From out them all- compounded is the same</p>
<p>Of bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, flesh, and thews-</p>
<p>All differing vastly in their forms, and built</p>
<p>Of elements dissimilar in shape.</p>
<p>Again, all things by fire consumed ablaze,</p>
<p>Within their frame lay up, if naught besides,</p>
<p>At least those atoms whence derives their power</p>
<p>To throw forth fire and send out light from under,</p>
<p>To shoot the sparks and scatter embers wide.</p>
<p>If, with like reasoning of mind, all else</p>
<p>Thou traverse through, thou wilt discover thus</p>
<p>That in their frame the seeds of many things</p>
<p>They hide, and divers shapes of seeds contain.</p>
<p>Further, thou markest much, to which are given</p>
<p>Along together colour and flavour and smell,</p>
<p>Among which, chief, are most burnt offerings.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Thus must they be of divers shapes composed.</p>
<p>A smell of scorching enters in our frame</p>
<p>Where the bright colour from the dye goes not;</p>
<p>And colour in one way, flavour in quite another</p>
<p>Works inward to our senses- so mayst see</p>
<p>They differ too in elemental shapes.</p>
<p>Thus unlike forms into one mass combine,</p>
<p>And things exist by intermixed seed.</p>
<p rend="indent">  But still 'tmust not be thought that in all ways</p>
<p>All things can be conjoined; for then wouldst view</p>
<p>Portents begot about thee every side:</p>
<p>Hulks of mankind half brute astarting up,</p>
<p>At times big branches sprouting from man's trunk,</p>
<p>Limbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit,</p>
<p>And nature along the all-producing earth</p>
<p>Feeding those dire Chimaeras breathing flame</p>
<p>From hideous jaws- Of which 'tis simple fact</p>
<p>That none have been begot; because we see</p>
<p>All are from fixed seed and fixed dam</p>
<p>Engendered and so function as to keep</p>
<p>Throughout their growth their own ancestral type.</p>
<p>This happens surely by a fixed law:</p>
<p>For from all food-stuff, when once eaten down,</p>
<p>Go sundered atoms, suited to each creature,</p>
<p>Throughout their bodies, and, conjoining there,</p>
<p>Produce the proper motions; but we see</p>
<p>How, contrariwise, nature upon the ground</p>
<p>Throws off those foreign to their frame; and many</p>
<p>With viewless bodies from their bodies fly,</p>
<p>By blows impelled- those impotent to join</p>
<p>To any part, or, when inside, to accord</p>
<p>And to take on the vital motions there.</p>
<p>But think not, haply, living forms alone</p>
<p>Are bound by these laws: they distinguished all.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>For just as all things of creation are,</p>
<p>In their whole nature, each to each unlike,</p>
<p>So must their atoms be in shape unlike-</p>
<p>Not since few only are fashioned of like form,</p>
<p>But since they all, as general rule, are not</p>
<p>The same as all. Nay, here in these our verses,</p>
<p>Elements many, common to many words,</p>
<p>Thou seest, though yet 'tis needful to confess</p>
<p>The words and verses differ, each from each,</p>
<p>Compounded out of different elements-</p>
<p>Not since few only, as common letters, run</p>
<p>Through all the words, or no two words are made,</p>
<p>One and the other, from all like elements,</p>
<p>But since they all, as general rule, are not</p>
<p>The same as all. Thus, too, in other things,</p>
<p>Whilst many germs common to many things</p>
<p>There are, yet they, combined among themselves,</p>
<p>Can form new wholes to others quite unlike.</p>
<p>Thus fairly one may say that humankind,</p>
<p>The grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up</p>
<p>Of different atoms. Further, since the seeds</p>
<p>Are different, difference must there also be</p>
<p>In intervening spaces, thoroughfares,</p>
<p>Connections, weights, blows, clashings, motions, all</p>
<p>Which not alone distinguish living forms,</p>
<p>But sunder earth's whole ocean from the lands,</p>
<p>And hold all heaven from the lands away.</p>

<p>The light of sun, yet recognise by touch</p>
<p>Things that from birth had ne'er a hue for them,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know that bodies can be brought</p>
<p>No less unto the ken of our minds too,</p>
<p>Though yet those bodies with no dye be smeared.</p>
<p>Again, ourselves whatever in the dark</p>
<p>We touch, the same we do not find to be</p>
<p>Tinctured with any colour.</p>
<p rend="indent">                          Now that here</p>
<p>I win the argument, I next will teach</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Now, every colour changes, none except,</p>
<p>And every...</p>
<p>Which the primordials ought nowise to do.</p>
<p>Since an immutable somewhat must remain,</p>
<p>Lest all things utterly be brought to naught.</p>
<p>For change of anything from out its bounds</p>
<p>Means instant death of that which was before.</p>
<p>Wherefore be mindful not to stain with colour</p>
<p>The seeds of things, lest things return for thee</p>
<p>All utterly to naught.</p>
<p rend="indent">                         But now, if seeds</p>
<p>Receive no property of colour, and yet</p>
<p>Be still endowed with variable forms</p>
<p>From which all kinds of colours they beget</p>
<p>And vary (by reason that ever it matters much</p>
<p>With what seeds, and in what positions joined,</p>
<p>And what the motions that they give and get),</p>
<p>Forthwith most easily thou mayst devise</p>
<p>Why what was black of hue an hour ago</p>
<p>Can of a sudden like the marble gleam,-</p>
<p>As ocean, when the high winds have upheaved</p>
<p>Its level plains, is changed to hoary waves</p>
<p>Of marble whiteness: for, thou mayst declare,</p>
<p>That, when the thing we often see as black</p>
<p>Is in its matter then commixed anew,</p>
<p>Some atoms rearranged, and some withdrawn,</p>
<p>And added some, 'tis seen forthwith to turn</p>
<p>Glowing and white. But if of azure seeds</p>
<p>Consist the level waters of the deep,</p>
<p>They could in nowise whiten: for however</p>
<p>Thou shakest azure seeds, the same can never</p>
<p>Pass into marble hue. But, if the seeds-</p>
<p>Which thus produce the ocean's one pure sheen-</p>
<p>Be now with one hue, now another dyed,</p>
<p>As oft from alien forms and divers shapes</p>
<p>A cube's produced all uniform in shape,</p>
<p>'Twould be but natural, even as in the cube</p>
<p>We see the forms to be dissimilar,</p>
<p>That thus we'd see in brightness of the deep</p>
<p>(Or in whatever one pure sheen thou wilt)</p>
<p>Colours diverse and all dissimilar.</p>
<p>Besides, the unlike shapes don't thwart the least</p>
<p>The whole in being externally a cube;</p>
<p>But differing hues of things do block and keep</p>
<p>The whole from being of one resultant hue.</p>
<p>Then, too, the reason which entices us</p>
<p>At times to attribute colours to the seeds</p>
<p>Falls quite to pieces, since white things are not</p>
<p>Create from white things, nor are black from black,</p>
<p>But evermore they are create from things</p>
<p>Of divers colours. Verily, the white</p>
<p>Will rise more readily, is sooner born</p>
<p>Out of no colour, than of black or aught</p>
<p>Which stands in hostile opposition thus.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="795"/>
<p rend="indent">  Besides, since colours cannot be, sans light,</p>
<p>And the primordials come not forth to light,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know they are not clothed with colour-</p>
<p>Truly, what kind of colour could there be</p>
<p>In the viewless dark? Nay, in the light itself</p>
<p>A colour changes, gleaming variedly,</p>
<p>When smote by vertical or slanting ray.</p>
<p>Thus in the sunlight shows the down of doves</p>
<p>That circles, garlanding, the nape and throat:</p>
<p>Now it is ruddy with a bright gold-bronze,</p>
<p>Now, by a strange sensation it becomes</p>
<p>Green-emerald blended with the coral-red.</p>
<p>The peacock's tail, filled with the copious light,</p>
<p>Changes its colours likewise, when it turns.</p>
<p>Wherefore, since by some blow of light begot,</p>
<p>Without such blow these colours can't become.</p>
<p rend="indent">  And since the pupil of the eye receives</p>
<p>Within itself one kind of blow, when said</p>
<p>To feel a white hue, then another kind,</p>
<p>When feeling a black or any other hue,</p>
<p>And since it matters nothing with what hue</p>
<p>The things thou touchest be perchance endowed,</p>
<p>But rather with what sort of shape equipped,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know the atoms need not colour,</p>
<p>But render forth sensations, as of touch,</p>
<p>That vary with their varied forms.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="817"/>
<p rend="indent">                                   Besides,</p>
<p>Since special shapes have not a special colour,</p>
<p>And all formations of the primal germs</p>
<p>Can be of any sheen thou wilt, why, then,</p>
<p>Are not those objects which are of them made</p>
<p>Suffused, each kind with colours of every kind?</p>
<p>For then 'twere meet that ravens, as they fly,</p>
<p>Should dartle from white pinions a white sheen,</p>
<p>Or swans turn black from seed of black, or be</p>
<p>Of any single varied dye thou wilt.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Again, the more an object's rent to bits,</p>
<p>The more thou see its colour fade away</p>
<p>Little by little till 'tis quite extinct;</p>
<p>As happens when the gaudy linen's picked</p>
<p>Shred after shred away: the purple there,</p>
<p>Phoenician red, most brilliant of all dyes,</p>
<p>Is lost asunder, ravelled thread by thread;</p>
<p>Hence canst perceive the fragments die away</p>
<p>From out their colour, long ere they depart</p>
<p>Back to the old primordials of things.</p>
<p>And, last, since thou concedest not all bodies</p>
<p>Send out a voice or smell, it happens thus</p>
<p>That not to all thou givest sounds and smells.</p>
<p>So, too, since we behold not all with eyes,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know some things there are as much</p>
<p>Orphaned of colour, as others without smell,</p>
<p>And reft of sound; and those the mind alert</p>
<p>No less can apprehend than it can mark</p>
<p>The things that lack some other qualities.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="842"/>
<p rend="indent">  But think not haply that the primal bodies</p>
<p>Remain despoiled alone of colour: so,</p>
<p>Are they from warmth dissevered and from cold</p>
<p>And from hot exhalations; and they move,</p>
<p>Both sterile of sound and dry of juice; and throw</p>
<p>Not any odour from their proper bodies.</p>
<p>Just as, when undertaking to prepare</p>
<p>A liquid balm of myrrh and marjoram,</p>
<p>And flower of nard, which to our nostrils breathes</p>
<p>Odour of nectar, first of all behooves</p>
<p>Thou seek, as far as find thou may and can,</p>
<p>The inodorous olive-oil (which never sends</p>
<p>One whiff of scent to nostrils), that it may</p>
<p>The least debauch and ruin with sharp tang</p>
<p>The odorous essence with its body mixed</p>
<p>And in it seethed. And on the same account</p>
<p>The primal germs of things must not be thought</p>
<p>To furnish colour in begetting things,</p>
<p>Nor sound, since pow'rless they to send forth aught</p>
<p>From out themselves, nor any flavour, too,</p>
<p>Nor cold, nor exhalation hot or warm.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>The rest; yet since these things are mortal all-</p>
<p>The pliant mortal, with a body soft;</p>
<p>The brittle mortal, with a crumbling frame;</p>
<p>The hollow with a porous-all must be</p>
<p>Disjoined from the primal elements,</p>
<p>If still we wish under the world to lay</p>
<p>Immortal ground-works, whereupon may rest</p>
<p>The sum of weal and safety, lest for thee</p>
<p>All things return to nothing utterly.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Now, too: whate'er we see possessing sense</p>
<p>Must yet confessedly be stablished all</p>
<p>From elements insensate. And those signs,</p>
<p>So clear to all and witnessed out of hand,</p>
<p>Do not refute this dictum nor oppose;</p>
<p>But rather themselves do lead us by the hand,</p>
<p>Compelling belief that living things are born</p>
<p>Of elements insensate, as I say.</p>
<p>Sooth, we may see from out the stinking dung</p>
<p>Live worms spring up, when, after soaking rains,</p>
<p>The drenched earth rots; and all things change the same:</p>
<p>Lo, change the rivers, the fronds, the gladsome pastures</p>
<p>Into the cattle, the cattle their nature change</p>
<p>Into our bodies, and from our body, oft</p>
<p>Grow strong the powers and bodies of wild beasts</p>
<p>And mighty-winged birds. Thus nature changes</p>
<p>All foods to living frames, and procreates</p>
<p>From them the senses of live creatures all,</p>
<p>In manner about as she uncoils in flames</p>
<p>Dry logs of wood and turns them all to fire.</p>
<p>And seest not, therefore, how it matters much</p>
<p>After what order are set the primal germs,</p>
<p>And with what other germs they all are mixed,</p>
<p>And what the motions that they give and get?</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="886"/>
<p rend="indent">  But now, what is't that strikes thy sceptic mind,</p>
<p>Constraining thee to sundry arguments</p>
<p>Against belief that from insensate germs</p>
<p>The sensible is gendered?- Verily,</p>
<p>'Tis this: that liquids, earth, and wood, though mixed,</p>
<p>Are yet unable to gender vital sense.</p>
<p>And, therefore, 'twill be well in these affairs</p>
<p>This to remember: that I have not said</p>
<p>Senses are born, under conditions all,</p>
<p>From all things absolutely which create</p>
<p>Objects that feel; but much it matters here</p>
<p>Firstly, how small the seeds which thus compose</p>
<p>The feeling thing, then, with what shapes endowed,</p>
<p>And lastly what they in positions be,</p>
<p>In motions, in arrangements. Of which facts</p>
<p>Naught we perceive in logs of wood and clods;</p>
<p>And yet even these, when sodden by the rains,</p>
<p>Give birth to wormy grubs, because the bodies</p>
<p>Of matter, from their old arrangements stirred</p>
<p>By the new factor, then combine anew</p>
<p>In such a way as genders living things.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Next, they who deem that feeling objects can</p>
<p>From feeling objects be create, and these,</p>
<p>In turn, from others that are wont to feel</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>When soft they make them; for all sense is linked</p>
<p>With flesh, and thews, and veins- and such, we see,</p>
<p>Are fashioned soft and of a mortal frame.</p>
<p>Yet be't that these can last forever on:</p>
<p>They'll have the sense that's proper to a part,</p>
<p>Or else be judged to have a sense the same</p>
<p>As that within live creatures as a whole.</p>
<p>But of themselves those parts can never feel,</p>
<p>For all the sense in every member back</p>
<p>To something else refers- a severed hand,</p>
<p>Or any other member of our frame,</p>
<p>Itself alone cannot support sensation.</p>
<p>It thus remains they must resemble, then,</p>
<p>Live creatures as a whole, to have the power</p>
<p>Of feeling sensation concordant in each part</p>
<p>With the vital sense; and so they're bound to feel</p>
<p>The things we feel exactly as do we.</p>
<p>If such the case, how, then, can they be named</p>
<p>The primal germs of things, and how avoid</p>
<p>The highways of destruction?- since they be</p>
<p>Mere living things and living things be all</p>
<p>One and the same with mortal. Grant they could,</p>
<p>Yet by their meetings and their unions all,</p>
<p>Naught would result, indeed, besides a throng</p>
<p>And hurly-burly all of living things-</p>
<p>Precisely as men, and cattle, and wild beasts,</p>
<p>By mere conglomeration each with each</p>
<p>Can still beget not anything of new.</p>
<p>But if by chance they lose, inside a body,</p>
<p>Their own sense and another sense take on,</p>
<p>What, then, avails it to assign them that</p>
<p>Which is withdrawn thereafter? And besides,</p>
<p>To touch on proof that we pronounced before,</p>
<p>Just as we see the eggs of feathered fowls</p>
<p>To change to living chicks, and swarming worms</p>
<p>To bubble forth when from the soaking rains</p>
<p>The earth is sodden, sure, sensations all</p>
<p>Can out of non-sensations be begot.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="931"/>
<p rend="indent">  But if one say that sense can so far rise</p>
<p>From non-sense by mutation, or because</p>
<p>Brought forth as by a certain sort of birth,</p>
<p>'Twill serve to render plain to him and prove</p>
<p>There is no birth, unless there be before</p>
<p>Some formed union of the elements,</p>
<p>Nor any change, unless they be unite.</p>
<p rend="indent">  In first place, senses can't in body be</p>
<p>Before its living nature's been begot,-</p>
<p>Since all its stuff, in faith, is held dispersed</p>
<p>About through rivers, air, and earth, and all</p>
<p>That is from earth created, nor has met</p>
<p>In combination, and, in proper mode,</p>
<p>Conjoined into those vital motions which</p>
<p>Kindle the all-perceiving senses- they</p>
<p>That keep and guard each living thing soever.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Again, a blow beyond its nature's strength</p>
<p>Shatters forthwith each living thing soe'er,</p>
<p>And on it goes confounding all the sense</p>
<p>Of body and mind. For of the primal germs</p>
<p>Are loosed their old arrangements, and, throughout,</p>
<p>The vital motions blocked,- until the stuff,</p>
<p>Shaken profoundly through the frame entire,</p>
<p>Undoes the vital knots of soul from body</p>
<p>And throws that soul, to outward wide-dispersed,</p>
<p>Through all the pores. For what may we surmise</p>
<p>A blow inflicted can achieve besides</p>
<p>Shaking asunder and loosening all apart?</p>
<p>It happens also, when less sharp the blow,</p>
<p>The vital motions which are left are wont</p>
<p>Oft to win out- win out, and stop and still</p>
<p>The uncouth tumults gendered by the blow,</p>
<p>And call each part to its own courses back,</p>
<p>And shake away the motion of death which now</p>
<p>Begins its own dominion in the body,</p>
<p>And kindle anew the senses almost gone.</p>
<p>For by what other means could they the more</p>
<p>Collect their powers of thought and turn again</p>
<p>From very doorways of destruction</p>
<p>Back unto life, rather than pass whereto</p>
<p>They be already well-nigh sped and so</p>
<p>Pass quite away?</p>
<p rend="indent">                   Again, since pain is there</p>
<p>Where bodies of matter, by some force stirred up,</p>
<p>Through vitals and through joints, within their seats</p>
<p>Quiver and quake inside, but soft delight,</p>
<p>When they remove unto their place again:</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know the primal germs can be</p>
<p>Assaulted by no pain, nor from themselves</p>
<p>Take no delight; because indeed they are</p>
<p>Not made of any bodies of first things,</p>
<p>Under whose strange new motions they might ache</p>
<p>Or pluck the fruit of any dear new sweet.</p>
<p>And so they must be furnished with no sense.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="973"/>
<p rend="indent">  Once more, if thus, that every living thing</p>
<p>May have sensation, needful 'tis to assign</p>
<p>Sense also to its elements, what then</p>
<p>Of those fixed elements from which mankind</p>
<p>Hath been, by their peculiar virtue, formed?</p>
<p>Of verity, they'll laugh aloud, like men,</p>
<p>Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,</p>
<p>Or sprinkle with dewy tear-drops cheeks and chins,</p>
<p>And have the cunning hardihood to say</p>
<p>Much on the composition of the world,</p>
<p>And in their turn inquire what elements</p>
<p>They have themselves,- since, thus the same in kind</p>
<p>As a whole mortal creature, even they</p>
<p>Must also be from other elements,</p>
<p>And then those others from others evermore-</p>
<p>So that thou darest nowhere make a stop.</p>
<p>Oho, I'll follow thee until thou grant</p>
<p>The seed (which here thou say'st speaks, laughs, and thinks)</p>
<p>Is yet derived out of other seeds</p>
<p>Which in their turn are doing just the same.</p>
<p>But if we see what raving nonsense this,</p>
<p>And that a man may laugh, though not, forsooth,</p>
<p>Compounded out of laughing elements,</p>
<p>And think and utter reason with learn'd speech,</p>
<p>Though not himself compounded, for a fact,</p>
<p>Of sapient seeds and eloquent, why, then,</p>
<p>Cannot those things which we perceive to have</p>
<p>Their own sensation be composed as well</p>
<p>Of intermixed seeds quite void of sense?</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="991"/>

<p rend="indent">  Once more, we all from seed celestial spring,</p>
<p>To all is that same father, from whom earth,</p>
<p>The fostering mother, as she takes the drops</p>
<p>Of liquid moisture, pregnant bears her broods-</p>
<p>The shining grains, and gladsome shrubs and trees,</p>
<p>And bears the human race and of the wild</p>
<p>The generations all, the while she yields</p>
<p>The foods wherewith all feed their frames and lead</p>
<p>The genial life and propagate their kind;</p>
<p>Wherefore she owneth that maternal name,</p>
<p>By old desert. What was before from earth,</p>
<p>The same in earth sinks back, and what was sent</p>
<p>From shores of ether, that, returning home,</p>
<p>The vaults of sky receive. Nor thus doth death</p>
<p>So far annihilate things that she destroys</p>
<p>The bodies of matter; but she dissipates</p>
<p>Their combinations, and conjoins anew</p>
<p>One element with others; and contrives</p>
<p>That all things vary forms and change their colours</p>
<p>And get sensations and straight give them o'er.</p>
<p>And thus may'st know it matters with what others</p>
<p>And in what structure the primordial germs</p>
<p>Are held together, and what motions they</p>
<p>Among themselves do give and get; nor think</p>
<p>That aught we see hither and thither afloat</p>
<p>Upon the crest of things, and now a birth</p>
<p>And straightway now a ruin, inheres at rest</p>
<p>Deep in the eternal atoms of the world.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Why, even in these our very verses here</p>
<p>It matters much with what and in what order</p>
<p>Each element is set: the same denote</p>
<p>Sky, and the ocean, lands, and streams, and sun;</p>
<p>The same, the grains, and trees, and living things.</p>
<p>And if not all alike, at least the most-</p>
<p>But what distinctions by positions wrought!</p>
<p>And thus no less in things themselves, when once</p>
<p>Around are changed the intervals between,</p>
<p>The paths of matter, its connections, weights,</p>
<p>Blows, clashings, motions, order, structure, shapes,</p>
<p>The things themselves must likewise changed be.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Now to true reason give thy mind for us.</p>
<p>Since here strange truth is putting forth its might</p>
<p>To hit thee in thine ears, a new aspect</p>
<p>Of things to show its front. Yet naught there is</p>
<p>So easy that it standeth not at first</p>
<p>More hard to credit than it after is;</p>
<p>And naught soe'er that's great to such degree,</p>
<p>Nor wonderful so far, but all mankind</p>
<p>Little by little abandon their surprise.</p>
<p>Look upward yonder at the bright clear sky</p>
<p>And what it holds- the stars that wander o'er,</p>
<p>The moon, the radiance of the splendour-sun:</p>
<p>Yet all, if now they first for mortals were,</p>
<p>If unforeseen now first asudden shown,</p>
<p>What might there be more wonderful to tell,</p>
<p>What that the nations would before have dared</p>
<p>Less to believe might be?- I fancy, naught-</p>
<p>So strange had been the marvel of that sight.</p>
<p>The which o'erwearied to behold, to-day</p>
<p>None deigns look upward to those lucent realms.</p>
<p>Then, spew not reason from thy mind away,</p>
<p>Beside thyself because the matter's new,</p>
<p>But rather with keen judgment nicely weigh;</p>
<p>And if to thee it then appeareth true,</p>
<p>Render thy hands, or, if 'tis false at last,</p>
<p>Gird thee to combat. For my mind-of-man</p>
<p>Now seeks the nature of the vast Beyond</p>
<p>There on the other side, that boundless sum</p>
<p>Which lies without the ramparts of the world,</p>
<p>Toward which the spirit longs to peer afar,</p>
<p>Toward which indeed the swift elan of thought</p>
<p>Flies unencumbered forth.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1048"/>
<p rend="indent">Firstly, we find,</p>
<p>Off to all regions round, on either side,</p>
<p>Above, beneath, throughout the universe</p>
<p>End is there none- as I have taught, as too</p>
<p>The very thing of itself declares aloud,</p>
<p>And as from nature of the unbottomed deep</p>
<p>Shines clearly forth. Nor can we once suppose</p>
<p>In any way 'tis likely, (seeing that space</p>
<p>To all sides stretches infinite and free,</p>
<p>And seeds, innumerable in number, in sum</p>
<p>Bottomless, there in many a manner fly,</p>
<p>Bestirred in everlasting motion there),</p>
<p>That only this one earth and sky of ours</p>
<p>Hath been create and that those bodies of stuff,</p>
<p>So many, perform no work outside the same;</p>
<p>Seeing, moreover, this world too hath been</p>
<p>By nature fashioned, even as seeds of things</p>
<p>By innate motion chanced to clash and cling-</p>
<p>After they'd been in many a manner driven</p>
<p>Together at random, without design, in vain-</p>
<p>And as at last those seeds together dwelt,</p>
<p>Which, when together of a sudden thrown,</p>
<p>Should alway furnish the commencements fit</p>
<p>Of mighty things- the earth, the sea, the sky,</p>
<p>And race of living creatures. Thus, I say,</p>
<p>Again, again, 'tmust be confessed there are</p>
<p>Such congregations of matter otherwhere,</p>
<p>Like this our world which vasty ether holds</p>
<p>In huge embrace.</p>
<p rend="indent">                   Besides, when matter abundant</p>
<p>Is ready there, when space on hand, nor object</p>
<p>Nor any cause retards, no marvel 'tis</p>
<p>That things are carried on and made complete,</p>
<p>Perforce. And now, if store of seeds there is</p>
<p>So great that not whole life-times of the living</p>
<p>Can count the tale...</p>
<p>And if their force and nature abide the same,</p>
<p>Able to throw the seeds of things together</p>
<p>Into their places, even as here are thrown</p>
<p>The seeds together in this world of ours,</p>
<p>'Tmust be confessed in other realms there are</p>
<p>Still other worlds, still other breeds of men,</p>
<p>And other generations of the wild.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Hence too it happens in the sum there is</p>
<p>No one thing single of its kind in birth,</p>
<p>And single and sole in growth, but rather it is</p>
<p>One member of some generated race,</p>
<p>Among full many others of like kind.</p>
<p>First, cast thy mind abroad upon the living:</p>
<p>Thou'lt find the race of mountain-ranging wild</p>
<p>Even thus to be, and thus the scions of men</p>
<p>To be begot, and lastly the mute flocks</p>
<p>Of scaled fish, and winged frames of birds.</p>
<p>Wherefore confess we must on grounds the same</p>
<p>That earth, sun, moon, and ocean, and all else,</p>
<p>Exist not sole and single- rather in number</p>
<p>Exceeding number. Since that deeply set</p>
<p>Old boundary stone of life remains for them</p>
<p>No less, and theirs a body of mortal birth</p>
<p>No less, than every kind which here on earth</p>
<p>Is so abundant in its members found.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Which well perceived if thou hold in mind,</p>

<p>At once to heat with fires ethereal all</p>
<p>The fruitful lands of multitudes of worlds,</p>
<p>To be at all times in all places near,</p>

<p>The serene spaces of the sky with sound,</p>
<p>And hurl his lightnings,- ha, and whelm how oft</p>
<p>In ruins his own temples, and to rave,</p>

<p rend="indent">  Ere since the birth-time of the world, ere since</p>
<p>The risen first-born day of sea, earth, sun,</p>
<p>Have many germs been added from outside,</p>
<p>Have many seeds been added round about,</p>
<p>Which the great All, the while it flung them on,</p>
<p>Brought hither, that from them the sea and lands</p>
<p>Could grow more big, and that the house of heaven</p>
<p>Might get more room and raise its lofty roofs</p>
<p>Far over earth, and air arise around.</p>
<p>For bodies all, from out all regions, are</p>
<p>Divided by blows, each to its proper thing,</p>
<p>And all retire to their own proper kinds:</p>
<p>The moist to moist retires; earth gets increase</p>
<p>From earthy body; and fires, as on a forge,</p>
<p>Beat out new fire; and ether forges ether;</p>
<p>Till nature, author and ender of the world,</p>
<p>Hath led all things to extreme bound of growth:</p>
<p>As haps when that which hath been poured inside</p>
<p>The vital veins of life is now no more</p>
<p>Than that which ebbs within them and runs off.</p>
<p>This is the point where life for each thing ends;</p>
<p>This is the point where nature with her powers</p>
<p>Curbs all increase. For whatsoe'er thou seest</p>
<p>Grow big with glad increase, and step by step</p>
<p>Climb upward to ripe age, these to themselves</p>
<p>Take in more bodies than they send from selves,</p>
<p>Whilst still the food is easily infused</p>
<p>Through all the veins, and whilst the things are not</p>
<p>So far expanded that they cast away</p>
<p>Such numerous atoms as to cause a waste</p>
<p>Greater than nutriment whereby they wax.</p>
<p>For 'tmust be granted, truly, that from things</p>
<p>Many a body ebbeth and runs off;</p>
<p>But yet still more must come, until the things</p>
<p>Have touched development's top pinnacle;</p>
<p>Then old age breaks their powers and ripe strength</p>

<p>For ever the ampler and more wide a thing,</p>
<p>As soon as ever its augmentation ends,</p>
<p>It scatters abroad forthwith to all sides round</p>
<p>More bodies, sending them from out itself.</p>
<p>Nor easily now is food disseminate</p>
<p>Through all its veins; nor is that food enough</p>
<p>To equal with a new supply on hand</p>
<p>Those plenteous exhalations it gives off.</p>
<p>Thus, fairly, all things perish, when with ebbing</p>
<p>They're made less dense and when from blows without</p>
<p>They are laid low; since food at last will fail</p>
<p>Extremest eld, and bodies from outside</p>

<p>Nor sea, nor breakers pounding on the rocks</p>
<p>Created them; but earth it was who bore-</p>

<p>Often he praises the fortunes of his sire,</p>
<p>And crackles, prating, how the ancient race,</p>
<p>Fulfilled with piety, supported life</p>

<p>And set my footsteps squarely planted now</p>

<p>For soon as ever thy planning thought that sprang</p>

<p>Of nature's courses, terrors of the brain</p>
<p>Asunder flee, the ramparts of the world</p>

<p>I see the movements of the universe.</p>
<p>Rises to vision the majesty of gods,</p>
<p>And their abodes of everlasting calm</p>
<p>Which neither wind may shake nor rain-cloud splash,</p>
<p>Nor snow, congealed by sharp frosts, may harm</p>
<p>With its white downfall: ever, unclouded sky</p>
<p>O'er roofs, and laughs with far-diffused light.</p>
<p>And nature gives to them their all, nor aught</p>
<p>May ever pluck their peace of mind away.</p>
<p>But nowhere to my vision rise no more</p>
<p>The vaults of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>, though the broad earth</p>
<p>Bars me no more from gazing down o'er all</p>
<p>Which under our feet is going on below</p>
<p>Along the void. O, here in these affairs</p>
<p>Some new divine delight and trembling awe</p>
<p>Takes hold through me, that thus by power of thine</p>
<p>Nature, so plain and manifest at last,</p>
<p>Hath been on every side laid bare to man!</p>
<p rend="indent">  And since I've taught already of what sort</p>

<p>And drive that dread of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> without,</p>
<p>Headlong, which so confounds our human life</p>
<p>Unto its deeps, pouring o'er all that is</p>
<p>The black of death, nor leaves not anything</p>
<p>To prosper- a liquid and unsullied joy.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="41"/>
<p>For as to what men sometimes will affirm:</p>
<p>That more than Tartarus (the realm of death)</p>
<p>They fear diseases and a life of shame,</p>
<p>And know the substance of the soul is blood,</p>
<p>Or rather wind (if haply thus their whim),</p>
<p>And so need naught of this our science, then</p>
<p>Thou well may'st note from what's to follow now</p>
<p>That more for glory do they braggart forth</p>
<p>Than for belief. For mark these very same:</p>
<p>Exiles from country, fugitives afar</p>
<p>From sight of men, with charges foul attaint,</p>
<p>Abased with every wretchedness, they yet</p>
<p>Live, and where'er the wretches come, they yet</p>
<p>Make the ancestral sacrifices there,</p>
<p>Butcher the black sheep, and to gods below</p>
<p>Offer the honours, and in bitter case</p>
<p>Turn much more keenly to religion.</p>
<p>Wherefore, it's surer testing of a man</p>
<p>In doubtful perils- mark him as he is</p>
<p>Amid adversities; for then alone</p>
<p>Are the true voices conjured from his breast,</p>
<p>The mask off-stripped, reality behind.</p>
<p>And greed, again, and the blind lust of honours</p>
<p>Which force poor wretches past the bounds of law,</p>
<p>And, oft allies and ministers of crime,</p>
<p>To push through nights and days with hugest toil</p>
<p>To rise untrammelled to the peaks of power-</p>
<p>These wounds of life in no mean part are kept</p>
<p>Festering and open by this fright of death.</p>
<p>For ever we see fierce Want and foul Disgrace</p>
<p>Dislodged afar from secure life and sweet,</p>
<p>Like huddling Shapes before the doors of death.</p>
<p>And whilst, from these, men wish to scape afar,</p>
<p>Driven by false terror, and afar remove,</p>
<p>With civic blood a fortune they amass,</p>
<p>They double their riches, greedy, heapers-up</p>
<p>Of corpse on corpse they have a cruel laugh</p>
<p>For the sad burial of a brother-born,</p>
<p>And hatred and fear of tables of their kin.</p>
<p>Likewise, through this same terror, envy oft</p>
<p>Makes them to peak because before their eyes</p>
<p>That man is lordly, that man gazed upon</p>
<p>Who walks begirt with honour glorious,</p>
<p>Whilst they in filth and darkness roll around;</p>
<p>Some perish away for statues and a name,</p>
<p>And oft to that degree, from fright of death,</p>
<p>Will hate of living and beholding light</p>
<p>Take hold on humankind that they inflict</p>
<p>Their own destruction with a gloomy heart-</p>
<p>Forgetful that this fear is font of cares,</p>
<p>This fear the plague upon their sense of shame,</p>
<p>And this that breaks the ties of comradry</p>
<p>And oversets all reverence and faith,</p>
<p>Mid direst slaughter. For long ere to-day</p>
<p>Often were traitors to country and dear parents</p>
<p>Through quest to shun the realms of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>.</p>
<p>For just as children tremble and fear all</p>
<p>In the viewless dark, so even we at times</p>
<p>Dread in the light so many things that be</p>
<p>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</p>
<p>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</p>
<p>This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,</p>
<p>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</p>
<p>Nor glittering arrows of morning sun disperse,</p>
<p>But only nature's aspect and her law.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="94"/>

<p rend="indent">  First, then, I say, the mind which oft we call</p>
<p>The intellect, wherein is seated life's</p>
<p>Counsel and regimen, is part no less</p>
<p>Of man than hand and foot and eyes are parts</p>
<p>Of one whole breathing creature. [But some hold]</p>
<p>That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated,</p>
<p>But is of body some one vital state,-</p>
<p>Named "harmony" by Greeks, because thereby</p>
<p>We live with sense, though intellect be not</p>
<p>In any part: as oft the body is said</p>
<p>To have good health (when health, however, 's not</p>
<p>One part of him who has it), so they place</p>
<p>The sense of mind in no fixed part of man.</p>
<p>Mightily, diversly, meseems they err.</p>
<p>Often the body palpable and seen</p>
<p>Sickens, while yet in some invisible part</p>
<p>We feel a pleasure; oft the other way,</p>
<p>A miserable in mind feels pleasure still</p>
<p>Throughout his body- quite the same as when</p>
<p>A foot may pain without a pain in head.</p>
<p>Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er</p>
<p>To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame</p>
<p>At random void of sense, a something else</p>
<p>Is yet within us, which upon that time</p>
<p>Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving</p>
<p>All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.</p>
<p>Now, for to see that in man's members dwells</p>
<p>Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont</p>
<p>To feel sensation by a "harmony"</p>
<p>Take this in chief: the fact that life remains</p>
<p>Oft in our limbs, when much of body's gone;</p>
<p>Yet that same life, when particles of heat,</p>
<p>Though few, have scattered been, and through the mouth</p>
<p>Air has been given forth abroad, forthwith</p>
<p>Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones.</p>
<p>Thus mayst thou know that not all particles</p>
<p>Perform like parts, nor in like manner all</p>
<p>Are props of weal and safety: rather those-</p>
<p>The seeds of wind and exhalations warm-</p>
<p>Take care that in our members life remains.</p>
<p>Therefore a vital heat and wind there is</p>
<p>Within the very body, which at death</p>
<p>Deserts our frames. And so, since nature of mind</p>
<p>And even of soul is found to be, as 'twere,</p>
<p>A part of man, give over "harmony"-</p>
<p>Name to musicians brought from Helicon,-</p>
<p>Unless themselves they filched it otherwise,</p>
<p>To serve for what was lacking name till then.</p>
<p>Whate'er it be, they're welcome to it- thou,</p>
<p>Hearken my other maxims.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="136"/>
<p rend="indent">                                Mind and soul,</p>
<p>I say, are held conjoined one with other,</p>
<p>And form one single nature of themselves;</p>
<p>But chief and regnant through the frame entire</p>
<p>Is still that counsel which we call the mind,</p>
<p>And that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.</p>
<p>Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts</p>
<p>Be blandishments of joys; and therefore here</p>
<p>The intellect, the mind. The rest of soul,</p>
<p>Throughout the body scattered, but obeys-</p>
<p>Moved by the nod and motion of the mind.</p>
<p>This, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought;</p>
<p>This for itself hath mirth, even when the thing</p>
<p>That moves it, moves nor soul nor body at all.</p>
<p>And as, when head or eye in us is smit</p>
<p>By assailing pain, we are not tortured then</p>
<p>Through all the body, so the mind alone</p>
<p>Is sometimes smitten, or livens with a joy,</p>
<p>Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs</p>
<p>And through the frame is stirred by nothing new.</p>
<p>But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce,</p>
<p>We mark the whole soul suffering all at once</p>
<p>Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread</p>
<p>Over the body, and the tongue is broken,</p>
<p>And fails the voice away, and ring the ears,</p>
<p>Mists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,-</p>
<p>Aye, men drop dead from terror of the mind.</p>
<p>Hence, whoso will can readily remark</p>
<p>That soul conjoined is with mind, and, when</p>
<p>'Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith</p>
<p>In turn it hits and drives the body too.</p>
<p rend="indent">  And this same argument establisheth</p>
<p>That nature of mind and soul corporeal is:</p>
<p>For when 'tis seen to drive the members on,</p>
<p>To snatch from sleep the body, and to change</p>
<p>The countenance, and the whole state of man</p>
<p>To rule and turn,- what yet could never be</p>
<p>Sans contact, and sans body contact fails-</p>
<p>Must we not grant that mind and soul consist</p>
<p>Of a corporeal nature?- And besides</p>
<p>Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours</p>
<p>Suffers the mind and with our body feels.</p>
<p>If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones</p>
<p>And bares the inner thews hits not the life,</p>
<p>Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse,</p>
<p>And, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind,</p>
<p>And whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.</p>
<p>So nature of mind must be corporeal, since</p>
<p>From stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Now, of what body, what components formed</p>
<p>Is this same mind I will go on to tell.</p>
<p>First, I aver, 'tis superfine, composed</p>
<p>Of tiniest particles- that such the fact</p>
<p>Thou canst perceive, if thou attend, from this:</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="182"/>
<p>Nothing is seen to happen with such speed</p>
<p>As what the mind proposes and begins;</p>
<p>Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly</p>
<p>Than aught whose nature's palpable to eyes.</p>
<p>But what's so agile must of seeds consist</p>
<p>Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved,</p>
<p>When hit by impulse slight. So water moves,</p>
<p>In waves along, at impulse just the least-</p>
<p>Being create of little shapes that roll;</p>
<p>But, contrariwise, the quality of honey</p>
<p>More stable is, its liquids more inert,</p>
<p>More tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter</p>
<p>Cleaves more together, since, indeed, 'tis made</p>
<p>Of atoms not so smooth, so fine, and round.</p>
<p>For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow</p>
<p>High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee</p>
<p>Downward from off the top; but, contrariwise,</p>
<p>A pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat</p>
<p>It can't at all. Thus, in so far as bodies</p>
<p>Are small and smooth, is their mobility;</p>
<p>But, contrariwise, the heavier and more rough,</p>
<p>The more immovable they prove. Now, then,</p>
<p>Since nature of mind is movable so much,</p>
<p>Consist it must of seeds exceeding small</p>
<p>And smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee,</p>
<p>Good friend, will serve thee opportune in else.</p>
<p>This also shows the nature of the same,</p>
<p>How nice its texture, in how small a space</p>
<p>'Twould go, if once compacted as a pellet:</p>
<p>When death's unvexed repose gets hold on man</p>
<p>And mind and soul retire, thou markest there</p>
<p>From the whole body nothing ta'en in form,</p>
<p>Nothing in weight. Death grants ye everything,</p>
<p>But vital sense and exhalation hot.</p>
<p>Thus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds,</p>
<p>Twined through the veins, the vitals, and the thews,</p>
<p>Seeing that, when 'tis from whole body gone,</p>
<p>The outward figuration of the limbs</p>
<p>Is unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.</p>
<p>Just so, when vanished the bouquet of wine,</p>
<p>Or when an unguent's perfume delicate</p>
<p>Into the winds away departs, or when</p>
<p>From any body savour's gone, yet still</p>
<p>The thing itself seems minished naught to eyes,</p>
<p>Thereby, nor aught abstracted from its weight-</p>
<p>No marvel, because seeds many and minute</p>
<p>Produce the savours and the redolence</p>
<p>In the whole body of the things.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="228"/>
<p rend="indent">And so,</p>
<p>Again, again, nature of mind and soul</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know created is of seeds</p>
<p>The tiniest ever, since at flying-forth</p>
<p>It beareth nothing of the weight away.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Yet fancy not its nature simple so.</p>
<p>For an impalpable aura, mixed with heat,</p>
<p>Deserts the dying, and heat draws off the air;</p>
<p>And heat there's none, unless commixed with air:</p>
<p>For, since the nature of all heat is rare,</p>
<p>Athrough it many seeds of air must move.</p>
<p>Thus nature of mind is triple; yet those all</p>
<p>Suffice not for creating sense- since mind</p>
<p>Accepteth not that aught of these can cause</p>
<p>Sense-bearing motions, and much less the thoughts</p>
<p>A man revolves in mind. So unto these</p>
<p>Must added be a somewhat, and a fourth;</p>
<p>That somewhat's altogether void of name;</p>
<p>Than which existeth naught more mobile, naught</p>
<p>More an impalpable, of elements</p>
<p>More small and smooth and round. That first transmits</p>
<p>Sense-bearing motions through the frame, for that</p>
<p>Is roused the first, composed of little shapes;</p>
<p>Thence heat and viewless force of wind take up</p>
<p>The motions, and thence air, and thence all things</p>
<p>Are put in motion; the blood is strook, and then</p>
<p>The vitals all begin to feel, and last</p>
<p>To bones and marrow the sensation comes-</p>
<p>Pleasure or torment. Nor will pain for naught</p>
<p>Enter so far, nor a sharp ill seep through,</p>
<p>But all things be perturbed to that degree</p>
<p>That room for life will fail, and parts of soul</p>
<p>Will scatter through the body's every pore.</p>
<p>Yet as a rule, almost upon the skin</p>
<p>These motion aIl are stopped, and this is why</p>
<p>We have the power to retain our life.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Now in my eagerness to tell thee how</p>
<p>They are commixed, through what unions fit</p>
<p>They function so, my country's pauper-speech</p>
<p>Constrains me sadly. As I can, however,</p>
<p>I'll touch some points and pass.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="262"/>
<p rend="indent">In such a wise</p>
<p>Course these primordials 'mongst one another</p>
<p>With inter-motions that no one can be</p>
<p>From other sundered, nor its agency</p>
<p>Perform, if once divided by a space;</p>
<p>Like many powers in one body they work.</p>
<p>As in the flesh of any creature still</p>
<p>Is odour and savour and a certain warmth,</p>
<p>And yet from all of these one bulk of body</p>
<p>Is made complete, so, viewless force of wind</p>
<p>And warmth and air, commingled, do create</p>
<p>One nature, by that mobile energy</p>
<p>Assisted which from out itself to them</p>
<p>Imparts initial motion, whereby first</p>
<p>Sense-bearing motion along the vitals springs.</p>
<p>For lurks this essence far and deep and under,</p>
<p>Nor in our body is aught more shut from view,</p>
<p>And 'tis the very soul of all the soul.</p>
<p>And as within our members and whole frame</p>
<p>The energy of mind and power of soul</p>
<p>Is mixed and latent, since create it is</p>
<p>Of bodies small and few, so lurks this fourth,</p>
<p>This essence void of name, composed of small,</p>
<p>And seems the very soul of all the soul,</p>
<p>And holds dominion o'er the body all.</p>
<p>And by like reason wind and air and heat</p>
<p>Must function so, commingled through the frame,</p>
<p>And now the one subside and now another</p>
<p>In interchange of dominance, that thus</p>
<p>From all of them one nature be produced,</p>
<p>Lest heat and wind apart, and air apart,</p>
<p>Make sense to perish, by disseverment.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="288"/>
<p>There is indeed in mind that heat it gets</p>
<p>When seething in rage, and flashes from the eyes</p>
<p>More swiftly fire; there is, again, that wind,</p>
<p>Much, and so cold, companion of all dread,</p>
<p>Which rouses the shudder in the shaken frame;</p>
<p>There is no less that state of air composed,</p>
<p>Making the tranquil breast, the serene face.</p>
<p>But more of hot have they whose restive hearts,</p>
<p>Whose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage-</p>
<p>Of which kind chief are fierce abounding lions,</p>
<p>Who often with roaring burst the breast o'erwrought,</p>
<p>Unable to hold the surging wrath within;</p>
<p>But the cold mind of stags has more of wind,</p>
<p>And speedier through their inwards rouses up</p>
<p>The icy currents which make their members quake.</p>
<p>But more the oxen live by tranquil air,</p>
<p>Nor e'er doth smoky torch of wrath applied,</p>
<p>O'erspreading with shadows of a darkling murk,</p>
<p>Rouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark,</p>
<p>Pierced through by icy javelins of fear;</p>
<p>But have their place half-way between the two-</p>
<p>Stags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:</p>
<p>Though training make them equally refined,</p>
<p>It leaves those pristine vestiges behind</p>
<p>Of each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose</p>
<p>Evil can e'er be rooted up so far</p>
<p>That one man's not more given to fits of wrath,</p>
<p>Another's not more quickly touched by fear,</p>
<p>A third not more long-suffering than he should.</p>
<p>And needs must differ in many things besides</p>
<p>The varied natures and resulting habits</p>
<p>Of humankind- of which not now can I</p>
<p>Expound the hidden causes, nor find names</p>
<p>Enough for all the divers shapes of those</p>
<p>Primordials whence this variation springs.</p>
<p>But this meseems I'm able to declare:</p>
<p>Those vestiges of natures left behind</p>
<p>Which reason cannot quite expel from us</p>
<p>Are still so slight that naught prevents a man</p>
<p>From living a life even worthy of the gods.</p>
<p rend="indent">  So then this soul is kept by all the body,</p>
<p>Itself the body's guard, and source of weal:</p>
<p>For they with common roots cleave each to each,</p>
<p>Nor can be torn asunder without death.</p>
<p>Not easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense</p>
<p>To tear their fragrance forth, without its nature</p>
<p>Perishing likewise: so, not easy 'tis</p>
<p>From all the body nature of mind and soul</p>
<p>To draw away, without the whole dissolved.</p>
<p>With seeds so intertwined even from birth,</p>
<p>They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life;</p>
<p>No energy of body or mind, apart,</p>
<p>Each of itself without the other's power,</p>
<p>Can have sensation; but our sense, enkindled</p>
<p>Along the vitals, to flame is blown by both</p>
<p>With mutual motions. Besides the body alone</p>
<p>Is nor begot nor grows, nor after death</p>
<p>Seen to endure. For not as water at times</p>
<p>Gives off the alien heat, nor is thereby</p>
<p>Itself destroyed, but unimpaired remains-</p>
<p>Not thus, I say, can the deserted frame</p>
<p>Bear the dissevering of its joined soul,</p>
<p>But, rent and ruined, moulders all away.</p>
<p>Thus the joint contact of the body and soul</p>
<p>Learns from their earliest age the vital motions,</p>
<p>Even when still buried in the mother's womb;</p>
<p>So no dissevering can hap to them,</p>
<p>Without their bane and ill. And thence mayst see</p>
<p>That, as conjoined is their source of weal,</p>
<p>Conjoined also must their nature be.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="350"/>
<p rend="indent">  If one, moreover, denies that body feel,</p>
<p>And holds that soul, through all the body mixed,</p>
<p>Takes on this motion which we title "sense,"</p>
<p>He battles in vain indubitable facts:</p>
<p>For who'll explain what body's feeling is,</p>
<p>Except by what the public fact itself</p>
<p>Has given and taught us? "But when soul is parted,</p>
<p>Body's without all sense." True!- loses what</p>
<p>Was even in its life-time not its own;</p>
<p>And much beside it loses, when soul's driven</p>
<p>Forth from that life-time. Or, to say that eyes</p>
<p>Themselves can see no thing, but through the same</p>
<p>The mind looks forth, as out of opened doors,</p>
<p>Is- a hard saying; since the feel in eyes</p>
<p>Says the reverse. For this itself draws on</p>
<p>And forces into the pupils of our eyes</p>
<p>Our consciousness. And note the case when often</p>
<p>We lack the power to see refulgent things,</p>
<p>Because our eyes are hampered by their light-</p>
<p>With a mere doorway this would happen not;</p>
<p>For, since it is our very selves that see,</p>
<p>No open portals undertake the toil.</p>
<p>Besides, if eyes of ours but act as doors,</p>
<p>Methinks that, were our sight removed, the mind</p>
<p>Ought then still better to behold a thing-</p>
<p>When even the door-posts have been cleared away.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Herein in these affairs nowise take up</p>
<p>What honoured sage, Democritus, lays down-</p>
<p>That proposition, that primordials</p>
<p>Of body and mind, each super-posed on each,</p>
<p>Vary alternately and interweave</p>
<p>The fabric of our members. For not only</p>
<p>Are the soul-elements smaller far than those</p>
<p>Which this our body and inward parts compose,</p>
<p>But also are they in their number less,</p>
<p>And scattered sparsely through our frame. And thus</p>
<p>This canst thou guarantee: soul's primal germs</p>
<p>Maintain between them intervals as large</p>
<p>At least as are the smallest bodies, which,</p>
<p>When thrown against us, in our body rouse</p>
<p>Sense-bearing motions.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="381"/>
<p rend="indent">Hence it comes that we</p>
<p>Sometimes don't feel alighting on our frames</p>
<p>The clinging dust, or chalk that settles soft;</p>
<p>Nor mists of night, nor spider's gossamer</p>
<p>We feel against us, when, upon our road,</p>
<p>Its net entangles us, nor on our head</p>
<p>The dropping of its withered garmentings;</p>
<p>Nor bird-feathers, nor vegetable down,</p>
<p>Flying about, so light they barely fall;</p>
<p>Nor feel the steps of every crawling thing,</p>
<p>Nor each of all those footprints on our skin</p>
<p>Of midges and the like. To that degree</p>
<p>Must many primal germs be stirred in us</p>
<p>Ere once the seeds of soul that through our frame</p>
<p>Are intermingled 'gin to feel that those</p>
<p>Primordials of the body have been strook,</p>
<p>And ere, in pounding with such gaps between,</p>
<p>They clash, combine and leap apart in turn.</p>
<p rend="indent">  But mind is more the keeper of the gates,</p>
<p>Hath more dominion over life than soul.</p>
<p>For without intellect and mind there's not</p>
<p>One part of soul can rest within our frame</p>
<p>Least part of time; companioning, it goes</p>
<p>With mind into the winds away, and leaves</p>
<p>The icy members in the cold of death.</p>
<p>But he whose mind and intellect abide</p>
<p>Himself abides in life. However much</p>
<p>The trunk be mangled, with the limbs lopped off,</p>
<p>The soul withdrawn and taken from the limbs,</p>
<p>Still lives the trunk and draws the vital air.</p>
<p>Even when deprived of all but all the soul,</p>
<p>Yet will it linger on and cleave to life,-</p>
<p>Just as the power of vision still is strong,</p>
<p>If but the pupil shall abide unharmed,</p>
<p>Even when the eye around it's sorely rent-</p>
<p>Provided only thou destroyest not</p>
<p>Wholly the ball, but, cutting round the pupil,</p>
<p>Leavest that pupil by itself behind-</p>
<p>For more would ruin sight. But if that centre,</p>
<p>That tiny part of eye, be eaten through,</p>
<p>Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes,</p>
<p>Though in all else the unblemished ball be clear.</p>
<p>'Tis by like compact that the soul and mind</p>
<p>Are each to other bound forevermore.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="417"/>

<p rend="indent">  Now come: that thou mayst able be to know</p>
<p>That minds and the light souls of all that live</p>
<p>Have mortal birth and death, I will go on</p>
<p>Verses to build meet for thy rule of life,</p>
<p>Sought after long, discovered with sweet toil.</p>
<p>But under one name I'd have thee yoke them both;</p>
<p>And when, for instance, I shall speak of soul,</p>
<p>Teaching the same to be but mortal, think</p>
<p>Thereby I'm speaking also of the mind-</p>
<p>Since both are one, a substance inter-joined.</p>
<p>First, then, since I have taught how soul exists</p>
<p>A subtle fabric, of particles minute,</p>
<p>Made up from atoms smaller much than those</p>
<p>Of water's liquid damp, or fog, or smoke,</p>
<p>So in mobility it far excels,</p>
<p>More prone to move, though strook by lighter cause</p>
<p>Even moved by images of smoke or fog-</p>
<p>As where we view, when in our sleeps we're lulled,</p>
<p>The altars exhaling steam and smoke aloft-</p>
<p>For, beyond doubt, these apparitions come</p>
<p>To us from outward. Now, then, since thou seest,</p>
<p>Their liquids depart, their waters flow away,</p>
<p>When jars are shivered, and since fog and smoke</p>
<p>Depart into the winds away, believe</p>
<p>The soul no less is shed abroad and dies</p>
<p>More quickly far, more quickly is dissolved</p>
<p>Back to its primal bodies, when withdrawn</p>
<p>From out man's members it has gone away.</p>
<p>For, sure, if body (container of the same</p>
<p>Like as a jar), when shivered from some cause,</p>
<p>And rarefied by loss of blood from veins,</p>
<p>Cannot for longer hold the soul, how then</p>
<p>Thinkst thou it can be held by any air-</p>
<p>A stuff much rarer than our bodies be?</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="445"/>
<p rend="indent">  Besides we feel that mind to being comes</p>
<p>Along with body, with body grows and ages.</p>
<p>For just as children totter round about</p>
<p>With frames infirm and tender, so there follows</p>
<p>A weakling wisdom in their minds; and then,</p>
<p>Where years have ripened into robust powers,</p>
<p>Counsel is also greater, more increased</p>
<p>The power of mind; thereafter, where already</p>
<p>The body's shattered by master-powers of eld,</p>
<p>And fallen the frame with its enfeebled powers,</p>
<p>Thought hobbles, tongue wanders, and the mind gives way;</p>
<p>All fails, all's lacking at the selfsame time.</p>
<p>Therefore it suits that even the soul's dissolved,</p>
<p>Like smoke, into the lofty winds of air;</p>
<p>Since we behold the same to being come</p>
<p>Along with body and grow, and, as I've taught,</p>
<p>Crumble and crack, therewith outworn by eld.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Then, too, we see, that, just as body takes</p>
<p>Monstrous diseases and the dreadful pain,</p>
<p>So mind its bitter cares, the grief, the fear;</p>
<p>Wherefore it tallies that the mind no less</p>
<p>Partaker is of death; for pain and disease</p>
<p>Are both artificers of death,- as well</p>
<p>We've learned by the passing of many a man ere now.</p>
<p>Nay, too, in diseases of body, often the mind</p>
<p>Wanders afield; for 'tis beside itself,</p>
<p>And crazed it speaks, or many a time it sinks,</p>
<p>With eyelids closing and a drooping nod,</p>
<p>In heavy drowse, on to eternal sleep;</p>
<p>From whence nor hears it any voices more,</p>
<p>Nor able is to know the faces here</p>
<p>Of those about him standing with wet cheeks</p>
<p>Who vainly call him back to light and life.</p>
<p>Wherefore mind too, confess we must, dissolves,</p>
<p>Seeing, indeed, contagions of disease</p>
<p>Enter into the same. Again, O why,</p>
<p>When the strong wine has entered into man,</p>
<p>And its diffused fire gone round the veins,</p>
<p>Why follows then a heaviness of limbs,</p>
<p>A tangle of the legs as round he reels,</p>
<p>A stuttering tongue, an intellect besoaked,</p>
<p>Eyes all aswim, and hiccups, shouts, and brawls,</p>
<p>And whatso else is of that ilk?- Why this?-</p>
<p>If not that violent and impetuous wine</p>
<p>Is wont to confound the soul within the body?</p>
<p>But whatso can confounded be and balked,</p>
<p>Gives proof, that if a hardier cause got in,</p>
<p>'Twould hap that it would perish then, bereaved</p>
<p>Of any life thereafter.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="487"/>
<p rend="indent">And, moreover,</p>
<p>Often will some one in a sudden fit,</p>
<p>As if by stroke of lightning, tumble down</p>
<p>Before our eyes, and sputter foam, and grunt,</p>
<p>Blither, and twist about with sinews taut,</p>
<p>Gasp up in starts, and weary out his limbs</p>
<p>With tossing round. No marvel, since distract</p>
<p>Through frame by violence of disease.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Confounds, he foams, as if to vomit soul,</p>
<p>As on the salt sea boil the billows round</p>
<p>Under the master might of winds. And now</p>
<p>A groan's forced out, because his limbs are griped,</p>
<p>But, in the main, because the seeds of voice</p>
<p>Are driven forth and carried in a mass</p>
<p>Outwards by mouth, where they are wont to go,</p>
<p>And have a builded highway. He becomes</p>
<p>Mere fool, since energy of mind and soul</p>
<p>Confounded is, and, as I've shown, to-riven,</p>
<p>Asunder thrown, and torn to pieces all</p>
<p>By the same venom. But, again, where cause</p>
<p>Of that disease has faced about, and back</p>
<p>Retreats sharp poison of corrupted frame</p>
<p>Into its shadowy lairs, the man at first</p>
<p>Arises reeling, and gradually comes back</p>
<p>To all his senses and recovers soul.</p>
<p>Thus, since within the body itself of man</p>
<p>The mind and soul are by such great diseases</p>
<p>Shaken, so miserably in labour distraught,</p>
<p>Why, then, believe that in the open air,</p>
<p>Without a body, they can pass their life,</p>
<p>Immortal, battling with the master winds?</p>
<p>And, since we mark the mind itself is cured,</p>
<p>Like the sick body, and restored can be</p>
<p>By medicine, this is forewarning too</p>
<p>That mortal lives the mind. For proper it is</p>
<p>That whosoe'er begins and undertakes</p>
<p>To alter the mind, or meditates to change</p>
<p>Any another nature soever, should add</p>
<p>New parts, or readjust the order given,</p>
<p>Or from the sum remove at least a bit.</p>
<p>But what's immortal willeth for itself</p>
<p>Its parts be nor increased, nor rearranged,</p>
<p>Nor any bit soever flow away:</p>
<p>For change of anything from out its bounds</p>
<p>Means instant death of that which was before.</p>
<p>Ergo, the mind, whether in sickness fallen,</p>
<p>Or by the medicine restored, gives signs,</p>
<p>As I have taught, of its mortality.</p>
<p>So surely will a fact of truth make head</p>
<p>'Gainst errors' theories all, and so shut off</p>
<p>All refuge from the adversary, and rout</p>
<p>Error by two-edged confutation.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="548"/>
<p rend="indent">  And since the mind is of a man one part,</p>
<p>Which in one fixed place remains, like ears,</p>
<p>And eyes, and every sense which pilots life;</p>
<p>And just as hand, or eye, or nose, apart,</p>
<p>Severed from us, can neither feel nor be,</p>
<p>But in the least of time is left to rot,</p>
<p>Thus mind alone can never be, without</p>
<p>The body and the man himself, which seems,</p>
<p>As 'twere the vessel of the same- or aught</p>
<p>Whate'er thou'lt feign as yet more closely joined:</p>
<p>Since body cleaves to mind by surest bonds.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Again, the body's and the mind's live powers</p>
<p>Only in union prosper and enjoy;</p>
<p>For neither can nature of mind, alone of self</p>
<p>Sans body, give the vital motions forth;</p>
<p>Nor, then, can body, wanting soul, endure</p>
<p>And use the senses. Verily, as the eye,</p>
<p>Alone, up-rended from its roots, apart</p>
<p>From all the body, can peer about at naught,</p>
<p>So soul and mind it seems are nothing able,</p>
<p>When by themselves. No marvel, because, commixed</p>
<p>Through veins and inwards, and through bones and thews,</p>
<p>Their elements primordial are confined</p>
<p>By all the body, and own no power free</p>
<p>To bound around through interspaces big,</p>
<p>Thus, shut within these confines, they take on</p>
<p>Motions of sense, which, after death, thrown out</p>
<p>Beyond the body to the winds of air,</p>
<p>Take on they cannot- and on this account,</p>
<p>Because no more in such a way confined.</p>
<p>For air will be a body, be alive,</p>
<p>If in that air the soul can keep itself,</p>
<p>And in that air enclose those motions all</p>
<p>Which in the thews and in the body itself</p>
<p>A while ago 'twas making. So for this,</p>
<p>Again, again, I say confess we must,</p>
<p>That, when the body's wrappings are unwound,</p>
<p>And when the vital breath is forced without,</p>
<p>The soul, the senses of the mind dissolve,-</p>
<p>Since for the twain the cause and ground of life</p>
<p>Is in the fact of their conjoined estate.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Once more, since body's unable to sustain</p>
<p>Division from the soul, without decay</p>
<p>And obscene stench, how canst thou doubt but that</p>
<p>The soul, uprisen from the body's deeps,</p>
<p>Has filtered away, wide-drifted like a smoke,</p>
<p>Or that the changed body crumbling fell</p>
<p>With ruin so entire, because, indeed,</p>
<p>Its deep foundations have been moved from place,</p>
<p>The soul out-filtering even through the frame,</p>
<p>And through the body's every winding way</p>
<p>And orifice? And so by many means</p>
<p>Thou'rt free to learn that nature of the soul</p>
<p>Hath passed in fragments out along the frame,</p>
<p>And that 'twas shivered in the very body</p>
<p>Ere ever it slipped abroad and swam away</p>
<p>Into the winds of air.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="592"/>
<p rend="indent">For never a man</p>
<p>Dying appears to feel the soul go forth</p>
<p>As one sure whole from all his body at once,</p>
<p>Nor first come up the throat and into mouth;</p>
<p>But feels it failing in a certain spot,</p>
<p>Even as he knows the senses too dissolve</p>
<p>Each in its own location in the frame.</p>
<p>But were this mind of ours immortal mind,</p>
<p>Dying 'twould scarce bewail a dissolution,</p>
<p>But rather the going, the leaving of its coat,</p>
<p>Like to a snake. Wherefore, when once the body</p>
<p>Hath passed away, admit we must that soul,</p>
<p>Shivered in all that body, perished too.</p>
<p>Nay, even when moving in the bounds of life,</p>
<p>Often the soul, now tottering from some cause,</p>
<p>Craves to go out, and from the frame entire</p>
<p>Loosened to be; the countenance becomes</p>
<p>Flaccid, as if the supreme hour were there;</p>
<p>And flabbily collapse the members all</p>
<p>Against the bloodless trunk- the kind of case</p>
<p>We see when we remark in common phrase,</p>
<p>"That man's quite gone," or "fainted dead away";</p>
<p>And where there's now a bustle of alarm,</p>
<p>And all are eager to get some hold upon</p>
<p>The man's last link of life. For then the mind</p>
<p>And all the power of soul are shook so sore,</p>
<p>And these so totter along with all the frame,</p>
<p>That any cause a little stronger might</p>
<p>Dissolve them altogether.- Why, then, doubt</p>
<p>That soul, when once without the body thrust,</p>
<p>There in the open, an enfeebled thing,</p>
<p>Its wrappings stripped away, cannot endure</p>
<p>Not only through no everlasting age,</p>
<p>But even, indeed, through not the least of time?</p>
<p rend="indent">  Then, too, why never is the intellect,</p>
<p>The counselling mind, begotten in the head,</p>
<p>The feet, the hands, instead of cleaving still</p>
<p>To one sole seat, to one fixed haunt, the breast,</p>
<p>If not that fixed places be assigned</p>
<p>For each thing's birth, where each, when 'tis create,</p>
<p>Is able to endure, and that our frames</p>
<p>Have such complex adjustments that no shift</p>
<p>In order of our members may appear?</p>
<p>To that degree effect succeeds to cause,</p>
<p>Nor is the flame once wont to be create</p>
<p>In flowing streams, nor cold begot in fire.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="624"/>
<p rend="indent">  Besides, if nature of soul immortal be,</p>
<p>And able to feel, when from our frame disjoined,</p>
<p>The same, I fancy, must be thought to be</p>
<p>Endowed with senses five,- nor is there way</p>
<p>But this whereby to image to ourselves</p>
<p>How under-souls may roam in <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>.</p>
<p>Thus painters and the elder race of bards</p>
<p>Have pictured souls with senses so endowed.</p>
<p>But neither eyes, nor nose, nor hand, alone</p>
<p>Apart from body can exist for soul,</p>
<p>Nor tongue nor ears apart. And hence indeed</p>
<p>Alone by self they can nor feel nor be.</p>
<p rend="indent">  And since we mark the vital sense to be</p>
<p>In the whole body, all one living thing,</p>
<p>If of a sudden a force with rapid stroke</p>
<p>Should slice it down the middle and cleave in twain,</p>
<p>Beyond a doubt likewise the soul itself,</p>
<p>Divided, dissevered, asunder will be flung</p>
<p>Along with body. But what severed is</p>
<p>And into sundry parts divides, indeed</p>
<p>Admits it owns no everlasting nature.</p>
<p>We hear how chariots of war, areek</p>
<p>With hurly slaughter, lop with flashing scythes</p>
<p>The limbs away so suddenly that there,</p>
<p>Fallen from the trunk, they quiver on the earth,</p>
<p>The while the mind and powers of the man</p>
<p>Can feel no pain, for swiftness of his hurt,</p>
<p>And sheer abandon in the zest of battle:</p>
<p>With the remainder of his frame he seeks</p>
<p>Anew the battle and the slaughter, nor marks</p>
<p>How the swift wheels and scythes of ravin have dragged</p>
<p>Off with the horses his left arm and shield;</p>
<p>Nor other how his right has dropped away,</p>
<p>Mounting again and on. A third attempts</p>
<p>With leg dismembered to arise and stand,</p>
<p>Whilst, on the ground hard by, the dying foot</p>
<p>Twitches its spreading toes. And even the head,</p>
<p>When from the warm and living trunk lopped off,</p>
<p>Keeps on the ground the vital countenance</p>
<p>And open eyes, until 't has rendered up</p>
<p>All remnants of the soul. Nay, once again:</p>
<p>If, when a serpent's darting forth its tongue,</p>
<p>And lashing its tail, thou gettest chance to hew</p>
<p>With axe its length of trunk to many parts,</p>
<p>Thou'lt see each severed fragment writhing round</p>
<p>With its fresh wound, and spattering up the sod,</p>
<p>And there the fore-part seeking with the jaws</p>
<p>After the hinder, with bite to stop the pain.</p>
<p>So shall we say that these be souls entire</p>
<p>In all those fractions?- but from that 'twould follow</p>
<p>One creature'd have in body many souls.</p>
<p>Therefore, the soul, which was indeed but one,</p>
<p>Has been divided with the body too:</p>
<p>Each is but mortal, since alike is each</p>
<p>Hewn into many parts. Again, how often</p>
<p>We view our fellow going by degrees,</p>
<p>And losing limb by limb the vital sense;</p>
<p>First nails and fingers of the feet turn blue,</p>
<p>Next die the feet and legs, then o'er the rest</p>
<p>Slow crawl the certain footsteps of cold death.</p>
<p>And since this nature of the soul is torn,</p>
<p>Nor mounts away, as at one time, entire,</p>
<p>We needs must hold it mortal. But perchance</p>
<p>If thou supposest that the soul itself</p>
<p>Can inward draw along the frame, and bring</p>
<p>Its parts together to one place, and so</p>
<p>From all the members draw the sense away,</p>
<p>Why, then, that place in which such stock of soul</p>
<p>Collected is, should greater seem in sense.</p>
<p>But since such place is nowhere, for a fact,</p>
<p>As said before, 'tis rent and scattered forth,</p>
<p>And so goes under. Or again, if now</p>
<p>I please to grant the false, and say that soul</p>
<p>Can thus be lumped within the frames of those</p>
<p>Who leave the sunshine, dying bit by bit,</p>
<p>Still must the soul as mortal be confessed;</p>
<p>Nor aught it matters whether to wrack it go,</p>
<p>Dispersed in the winds, or, gathered in a mass</p>
<p>From all its parts, sink down to brutish death,</p>
<p>Since more and more in every region sense</p>
<p>Fails the whole man, and less and less of life</p>
<p>In every region lingers.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="670"/>
<p rend="indent">                         And besides,</p>
<p>If soul immortal is, and winds its way</p>
<p>Into the body at the birth of man,</p>
<p>Why can we not remember something, then,</p>
<p>Of life-time spent before? why keep we not</p>
<p>Some footprints of the things we did of, old?</p>
<p>But if so changed hath been the power of mind,</p>
<p>That every recollection of things done</p>
<p>Is fallen away, at no o'erlong remove</p>
<p>Is that, I trow, from what we mean by death.</p>
<p>Wherefore 'tis sure that what hath been before</p>
<p>Hath died, and what now is is now create.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Moreover, if after the body hath been built</p>
<p>Our mind's live powers are wont to be put in,</p>
<p>Just at the moment that we come to birth,</p>
<p>And cross the sills of life, 'twould scarcely fit</p>
<p>For them to live as if they seemed to grow</p>
<p>Along with limbs and frame, even in the blood,</p>
<p>But rather as in a cavern all alone.</p>
<p>(Yet all the body duly throngs with sense.)</p>
<p>But public fact declares against all this:</p>
<p>For soul is so entwined through the veins,</p>
<p>The flesh, the thews, the bones, that even the teeth</p>
<p>Share in sensation, as proven by dull ache,</p>
<p>By twinge from icy water, or grating crunch</p>
<p>Upon a stone that got in mouth with bread.</p>
<p>Wherefore, again, again, souls must be thought</p>
<p>Nor void of birth, nor free from law of death;</p>
<p>Nor, if, from outward, in they wound their way,</p>
<p>Could they be thought as able so to cleave</p>
<p>To these our frames, nor, since so interwove,</p>
<p>Appears it that they're able to go forth</p>
<p>Unhurt and whole and loose themselves unscathed</p>
<p>From all the thews, articulations, bones.</p>
<p>But, if perchance thou thinkest that the soul,</p>
<p>From outward winding in its way, is wont</p>
<p>To seep and soak along these members ours,</p>
<p>Then all the more 'twill perish, being thus</p>
<p>With body fused- for what will seep and soak</p>
<p>Will be dissolved and will therefore die.</p>
<p>For just as food, dispersed through all the pores</p>
<p>Of body, and passed through limbs and all the frame,</p>
<p>Perishes, supplying from itself the stuff</p>
<p>For other nature, thus the soul and mind,</p>
<p>Though whole and new into a body going,</p>
<p>Are yet, by seeping in, dissolved away,</p>
<p>Whilst, as through pores, to all the frame there pass</p>
<p>Those particles from which created is</p>
<p>This nature of mind, now ruler of our body,</p>
<p>Born from that soul which perished, when divided</p>
<p>Along the frame.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="711"/>
<p rend="indent">Wherefore it seems that soul</p>
<p>Hath both a natal and funeral hour.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Besides are seeds of soul there left behind</p>
<p>In the breathless body, or not? If there they are,</p>
<p>It cannot justly be immortal deemed,</p>
<p>Since, shorn of some parts lost, 'thas gone away:</p>
<p>But if, borne off with members uncorrupt,</p>
<p>'Thas fled so absolutely all away</p>
<p>It leaves not one remainder of itself</p>
<p>Behind in body, whence do cadavers, then,</p>
<p>From out their putrid flesh exhale the worms,</p>
<p>And whence does such a mass of living things,</p>
<p>Boneless and bloodless, o'er the bloated frame</p>
<p>Bubble and swarm? But if perchance thou thinkest</p>
<p>That souls from outward into worms can wind,</p>
<p>And each into a separate body come,</p>
<p>And reckonest not why many thousand souls</p>
<p>Collect where only one has gone away,</p>
<p>Here is a point, in sooth, that seems to need</p>
<p>Inquiry and a putting to the test:</p>
<p>Whether the souls go on a hunt for seeds</p>
<p>Of worms wherewith to build their dwelling places,</p>
<p>Or enter bodies ready-made, as 'twere.</p>
<p>But why themselves they thus should do and toil</p>
<p>'Tis hard to say, since, being free of body,</p>
<p>They flit around, harassed by no disease,</p>
<p>Nor cold nor famine; for the body labours</p>
<p>By more of kinship to these flaws of life,</p>
<p>And mind by contact with that body suffers</p>
<p>So many ills. But grant it be for them</p>
<p>However useful to construct a body</p>
<p>To which to enter in, 'tis plain they can't.</p>
<p>Then, souls for self no frames nor bodies make,</p>
<p>Nor is there how they once might enter in</p>
<p>To bodies ready-made- for they cannot</p>
<p>Be nicely interwoven with the same,</p>
<p>And there'll be formed no interplay of sense</p>
<p>Common to each.</p>

<p rend="indent">                   Again, why is't there goes</p>
<p>Impetuous rage with lion's breed morose,</p>
<p>And cunning with foxes, and to deer why given</p>
<p>The ancestral fear and tendency to flee,</p>
<p>And why in short do all the rest of traits</p>
<p>Engender from the very start of life</p>
<p>In the members and mentality, if not</p>
<p>Because one certain power of mind that came</p>
<p>From its own seed and breed waxes the same</p>
<p>Along with all the body? But were mind</p>
<p>Immortal, were it wont to change its bodies,</p>
<p>How topsy-turvy would earth's creatures act!</p>
<p>The Hyrcan hound would flee the onset oft</p>
<p>Of antlered stag, the scurrying hawk would quake</p>
<p>Along the winds of air at the coming dove,</p>
<p>And men would dote, and savage beasts be wise;</p>
<p>For false the reasoning of those that say</p>
<p>Immortal mind is changed by change of body-</p>
<p>For what is changed dissolves, and therefore dies.</p>
<p>For parts are re-disposed and leave their order;</p>
<p>Wherefore they must be also capable</p>
<p>Of dissolution through the frame at last,</p>
<p>That they along with body perish all.</p>
<p>But should some say that always souls of men</p>
<p>Go into human bodies, I will ask:</p>
<p>How can a wise become a dullard soul?</p>
<p>And why is never a child's a prudent soul?</p>
<p>And the mare's filly why not trained so well</p>
<p>As sturdy strength of steed? We may be sure</p>
<p>They'll take their refuge in the thought that mind</p>
<p>Becomes a weakling in a weakling frame.</p>
<p>Yet be this so, 'tis needful to confess</p>
<p>The soul but mortal, since, so altered now</p>
<p>Throughout the frame, it loses the life and sense</p>
<p>It had before. Or how can mind wax strong</p>
<p>Coequally with body and attain</p>
<p>The craved flower of life, unless it be</p>
<p>The body's colleague in its origins?</p>
<p>Or what's the purport of its going forth</p>
<p>From aged limbs?- fears it, perhaps, to stay,</p>
<p>Pent in a crumbled body? Or lest its house,</p>
<p>Outworn by venerable length of days,</p>
<p>May topple down upon it? But indeed</p>
<p>For an immortal perils are there none.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="776"/>
<p rend="indent">  Again, at parturitions of the wild</p>
<p>And at the rites of Love, that souls should stand</p>
<p>Ready hard by seems ludicrous enough-</p>
<p>Immortals waiting for their mortal limbs</p>
<p>In numbers innumerable, contending madly</p>
<p>Which shall be first and chief to enter in!-</p>
<p>Unless perchance among the souls there be</p>
<p>Such treaties stablished that the first to come</p>
<p>Flying along, shall enter in the first,</p>
<p>And that they make no rivalries of strength!</p>
<p rend="indent">  Again, in ether can't exist a tree,</p>
<p>Nor clouds in ocean deeps, nor in the fields</p>
<p>Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,</p>
<p>Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged</p>
<p>Where everything may grow and have its place.</p>
<p>Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone</p>
<p>Without the body, nor exist afar</p>
<p>From thews and blood. But if 'twere possible,</p>
<p>Much rather might this very power of mind</p>
<p>Be in the head, the shoulders or the heels,</p>
<p>And, born in any part soever, yet</p>
<p>In the same man, in the same vessel abide.</p>
<p>But since within this body even of ours</p>
<p>Stands fixed and appears arranged sure</p>
<p>Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,</p>
<p>Deny we must the more that they can have</p>
<p>Duration and birth, wholly outside the frame.</p>
<p>For, verily, the mortal to conjoin</p>
<p>With the eternal, and to feign they feel</p>
<p>Together, and can function each with each,</p>
<p>Is but to dote: for what can be conceived</p>
<p>Of more unlike, discrepant, ill-assorted,</p>
<p>Than something mortal in a union joined</p>
<p>With an immortal and a secular</p>
<p>To bear the outrageous tempests?</p>
<p rend="indent">                            Then, again,</p>
<p>Whatever abides eternal must indeed</p>
<p>Either repel all strokes, because 'tis made</p>
<p>Of solid body, and permit no entrance</p>
<p>Of aught with power to sunder from within</p>
<p>The parts compact- as are those seeds of stuff</p>
<p>Whose nature we've exhibited before;</p>
<p>Or else be able to endure through time</p>
<p>For this: because they are from blows exempt,</p>
<p>As is the void, the which abides untouched,</p>
<p>Unsmit by any stroke; or else because</p>
<p>There is no room around, whereto things can,</p>
<p>As 'twere, depart in dissolution all,-</p>
<p>Even as the sum of sums eternal is,</p>
<p>Without or place beyond whereto things may</p>
<p>Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite,</p>
<p>And thus dissolve them by the blows of might.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="819"/>
<p rend="indent">  But if perchance the soul's to be adjudged</p>
<p>Immortal, mainly on ground 'tis kept secure</p>
<p>In vital forces- either because there come</p>
<p>Never at all things hostile to its weal,</p>
<p>Or else because what come somehow retire,</p>

<p>That which torments it with the things to be,</p>
<p>Keeps it in dread, and wearies it with cares;</p>
<p>And even when evil acts are of the past,</p>
<p>Still gnaw the old transgressions bitterly.</p>
<p>Add, too, that frenzy, peculiar to the mind,</p>
<p>And that oblivion of the things that were;</p>
<p>Add its submergence in the murky waves</p>
<p>Of drowse and torpor.</p>

<p rend="indent">                        Therefore death to us</p>
<p>Is nothing, nor concerns us in the least,</p>
<p>Since nature of mind is mortal evermore.</p>
<p>And just as in the ages gone before</p>
<p>We felt no touch of ill, when all sides round</p>
<p>To battle came the Carthaginian host,</p>
<p>And the times, shaken by tumultuous war,</p>
<p>Under the aery coasts of arching heaven</p>
<p>Shuddered and trembled, and all humankind</p>
<p>Doubted to which the empery should fall</p>
<p>By land and sea, thus when we are no more,</p>
<p>When comes that sundering of our body and soul</p>
<p>Through which we're fashioned to a single state,</p>
<p>Verily naught to us, us then no more,</p>
<p>Can come to pass, naught move our senses then-</p>
<p>No, not if earth confounded were with sea,</p>
<p>And sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel</p>
<p>The nature of mind and energy of soul,</p>
<p>After their severance from this body of ours,</p>
<p>Yet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds</p>
<p>And wedlock of the soul and body live,</p>
<p>Through which we're fashioned to a single state.</p>
<p>And, even if time collected after death</p>
<p>The matter of our frames and set it all</p>
<p>Again in place as now, and if again</p>
<p>To us the light of life were given, O yet</p>
<p>That process too would not concern us aught,</p>
<p>When once the self-succession of our sense</p>
<p>Has been asunder broken. And now and here,</p>
<p>Little enough we're busied with the selves</p>
<p>We were aforetime, nor, concerning them,</p>
<p>Suffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze</p>
<p>Backwards across all yesterdays of time</p>
<p>The immeasurable, thinking how manifold</p>
<p>The motions of matter are, then couldst thou well</p>
<p>Credit this too: often these very seeds</p>
<p>(From which we are to-day) of old were set</p>
<p>In the same order as they are to-day-</p>
<p>Yet this we can't to consciousness recall</p>
<p>Through the remembering mind. For there hath been</p>
<p>An interposed pause of life, and wide</p>
<p>Have all the motions wandered everywhere</p>
<p>From these our senses. For if woe and ail</p>
<p>Perchance are toward, then the man to whom</p>
<p>The bane can happen must himself be there</p>
<p>At that same time. But death precludeth this,</p>
<p>Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd</p>
<p>Such irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:</p>
<p>Nothing for us there is to dread in death,</p>
<p>No wretchedness for him who is no more,</p>
<p>The same estate as if ne'er born before,</p>
<p>When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="870"/>
<p rend="indent">  Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because</p>
<p>When dead he rots with body laid away,</p>
<p>Or perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,</p>
<p>Know well: he rings not true, and that beneath</p>
<p>Still works an unseen sting upon his heart,</p>
<p>However he deny that he believes.</p>
<p>His shall be aught of feeling after death.</p>
<p>For he, I fancy, grants not what he says,</p>
<p>Nor what that presupposes, and he fails</p>
<p>To pluck himself with all his roots from life</p>
<p>And cast that self away, quite unawares</p>
<p>Feigning that some remainder's left behind.</p>
<p>For when in life one pictures to oneself</p>
<p>His body dead by beasts and vultures torn,</p>
<p>He pities his state, dividing not himself</p>
<p>Therefrom, removing not the self enough</p>
<p>From the body flung away, imagining</p>
<p>Himself that body, and projecting there</p>
<p>His own sense, as he stands beside it: hence</p>
<p>He grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks</p>
<p>That in true death there is no second self</p>
<p>Alive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,</p>
<p>Or stand lamenting that the self lies there</p>
<p>Mangled or burning. For if it an evil is</p>
<p>Dead to be jerked about by jaw and fang</p>
<p>Of the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not</p>
<p>Bitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,</p>
<p>Or suffocate in honey, and, reclined</p>

<p>But ask the mourner what's the bitterness</p>
<p>That man should waste in an eternal grief,</p>
<p>If, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?</p>

<p>Yet not at all do those primordial germs</p>
<p>Roam round our members, at that time, afar</p>
<p>From their own motions that produce our senses-</p>
<p>Since, when he's startled from his sleep, a man</p>
<p>Collects his senses. Death is, then, to us</p>
<p>Much less- if there can be a less than that</p>
<p>Which is itself a nothing: for there comes</p>

<p>From that dread rock of infamy, the stripes,</p>
<p>The executioners, the oaken rack,</p>
<p>The iron plates, bitumen, and the torch.</p>
<p>And even though these are absent, yet the mind,</p>
<p>With a fore-fearing conscience, plies its goads</p>
<p>And burns beneath the lash, nor sees meanwhile</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="1"/>

<p>I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,</p>
<p>Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,</p>
<p>Trodden by step of none before. I joy</p>
<p>To come on undefiled fountains there,</p>
<p>To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,</p>
<p>To seek for this my head a signal crown</p>
<p>From regions where the Muses never yet</p>
<p>Have garlanded the temples of a man:</p>
<p>First, since I teach concerning mighty things,</p>
<p>And go right on to loose from round the mind</p>
<p>The tightened coils of dread religion;</p>
<p>Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame</p>
<p>Song so pellucid, touching all throughout</p>
<p>Even with the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem,</p>
<p>Is not without a reasonable ground:</p>
<p>For as physicians, when they seek to give</p>
<p>Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch</p>
<p>The brim around the cup with the sweet juice</p>
<p>And yellow of the honey, in order that</p>
<p>The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled</p>
<p>As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down</p>
<p>The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,</p>
<p>Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus</p>
<p>Grow strong again with recreated health:</p>
<p>So now I too (since this my doctrine seems</p>
<p>In general somewhat woeful unto those</p>
<p>Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd</p>
<p>Starts back from it in horror) have desired</p>
<p>To expound our doctrine unto thee in song</p>
<p>Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,</p>
<p>To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse-</p>
<p>If by such method haply I might hold</p>
<p>The mind of thee upon these lines of ours,</p>
<p>Till thou dost learn the nature of all things</p>
<p>And understandest their utility.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="26"/>

<p rend="indent">  But since I've taught already of what sort</p>
<p>The seeds of all things are, and how distinct</p>
<p>In divers forms they flit of own accord,</p>
<p>Stirred with a motion everlasting on,</p>
<p>And in what mode things be from them create,</p>
<p>And since I've taught what the mind's nature is,</p>
<p>And of what things 'tis with the body knit</p>
<p>And thrives in strength, and by what mode uptorn</p>
<p>That mind returns to its primordials,</p>
<p>Now will I undertake an argument-</p>
<p>One for these matters of supreme concern-</p>
<p>That there exist those somewhats which we call</p>
<p>The images of things: these, like to films</p>
<p>Scaled off the utmost outside of the things,</p>
<p>Flit hither and thither through the atmosphere,</p>
<p>And the same terrify our intellects,</p>
<p>Coming upon us waking or in sleep,</p>
<p>When oft we peer at wonderful strange shapes</p>
<p>And images of people lorn of light,</p>
<p>Which oft have horribly roused us when we lay</p>
<p>In slumber- that haply nevermore may we</p>
<p>Suppose that souls get loose from <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>,</p>
<p>Or shades go floating in among the living,</p>
<p>Or aught of us is left behind at death,</p>
<p>When body and mind, destroyed together, each</p>
<p>Back to its own primordials goes away.</p>
<p rend="indent">  And thus I say that effigies of things,</p>
<p>And tenuous shapes from off the things are sent,</p>
<p>From off the utmost outside of the things,</p>
<p>Which are like films or may be named a rind,</p>
<p>Because the image bears like look and form</p>
<p>With whatso body has shed it fluttering forth-</p>
<p>A fact thou mayst, however dull thy wits,</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="54"/>
<p>Well learn from this: mainly, because we see</p>
<p>Even 'mongst visible objects many be</p>
<p>That send forth bodies, loosely some diffused-</p>
<p>Like smoke from oaken logs and heat from fires-</p>
<p>And some more interwoven and condensed-</p>
<p>As when the locusts in the summertime</p>
<p>Put off their glossy tunics, or when calves</p>
<p>At birth drop membranes from their body's surface,</p>
<p>Or when, again, the slippery serpent doffs</p>
<p>Its vestments 'mongst the thorns- for oft we see</p>
<p>The breres augmented with their flying spoils:</p>
<p>Since such takes place, 'tis likewise certain too</p>
<p>That tenuous images from things are sent,</p>
<p>From off the utmost outside of the things.</p>
<p>For why those kinds should drop and part from things,</p>
<p>Rather than others tenuous and thin,</p>
<p>No power has man to open mouth to tell;</p>
<p>Especially, since on outsides of things</p>
<p>Are bodies many and minute which could,</p>
<p>In the same order which they had before,</p>
<p>And with the figure of their form preserved,</p>
<p>Be thrown abroad, and much more swiftly too,</p>
<p>Being less subject to impediments,</p>
<p>As few in number and placed along the front.</p>
<p>For truly many things we see discharge</p>
<p>Their stuff at large, not only from their cores</p>
<p>Deep-set within, as we have said above,</p>
<p>But from their surfaces at times no less-</p>
<p>Their very colours too. And commonly</p>
<p>The awnings, saffron, red and dusky blue,</p>
<p>Stretched overhead in mighty theatres,</p>
<p>Upon their poles and cross-beams fluttering,</p>
<p>Have such an action quite; for there they dye</p>
<p>And make to undulate with their every hue</p>
<p>The circled throng below, and all the stage,</p>
<p>And rich attire in the patrician seats.</p>
<p>And ever the more the theatre's dark walls</p>
<p>Around them shut, the more all things within</p>
<p>Laugh in the bright suffusion of strange glints,</p>
<p>The daylight being withdrawn. And therefore, since</p>
<p>The canvas hangings thus discharge their dye</p>
<p>From off their surface, things in general must</p>
<p>Likewise their tenuous effigies discharge,</p>
<p>Because in either case they are off-thrown</p>
<p>From off the surface. So there are indeed</p>
<p>Such certain prints and vestiges of forms</p>
<p>Which flit around, of subtlest texture made,</p>
<p>Invisible, when separate, each and one.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="90"/>
<p>Again, all odour, smoke, and heat, and such</p>
<p>Streams out of things diffusedly, because,</p>
<p>Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth</p>
<p>And rising out, along their bending path</p>
<p>They're torn asunder, nor have gateways straight</p>
<p>Wherethrough to mass themselves and struggle abroad.</p>
<p>But contrariwise, when such a tenuous film</p>
<p>Of outside colour is thrown off, there's naught</p>
<p>Can rend it, since 'tis placed along the front</p>
<p>Ready to hand. Lastly those images</p>
<p>Which to our eyes in mirrors do appear,</p>
<p>In water, or in any shining surface,</p>
<p>Must be, since furnished with like look of things,</p>
<p>Fashioned from images of things sent out.</p>
<p>There are, then, tenuous effigies of forms,</p>
<p>Like unto them, which no one can divine</p>
<p>When taken singly, which do yet give back,</p>
<p>When by continued and recurrent discharge</p>
<p>Expelled, a picture from the mirrors' plane.</p>
<p>Nor otherwise, it seems, can they be kept</p>
<p>So well conserved that thus be given back</p>
<p>Figures so like each object.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="110"/>
<p rend="indent">                          Now then, learn</p>
<p>How tenuous is the nature of an image.</p>
<p>And in the first place, since primordials be</p>
<p>So far beneath our senses, and much less</p>
<p>E'en than those objects which begin to grow</p>
<p>Too small for eyes to note, learn now in few</p>
<p>How nice are the beginnings of all things-</p>
<p>That this, too, I may yet confirm in proof:</p>
<p>First, living creatures are sometimes so small</p>
<p>That even their third part can nowise be seen;</p>
<p>Judge, then, the size of any inward organ-</p>
<p>What of their sphered heart, their eyes, their limbs,</p>
<p>The skeleton?- How tiny thus they are!</p>
<p>And what besides of those first particles</p>
<p>Whence soul and mind must fashioned be?- <placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> not</p>
<p>How nice and how minute? Besides, whatever</p>
<p>Exhales from out its body a sharp smell-</p>
<p>The nauseous absinth, or the panacea,</p>
<p>Strong southernwood, or bitter centaury-</p>
<p>If never so lightly with thy [fingers] twain</p>
<p>Perchance [thou touch] a one of them</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Then why not rather know that images</p>
<p>Flit hither and thither, many, in many modes,</p>
<p>Bodiless and invisible?</p>
<p rend="indent">                                   But lest</p>
<p>Haply thou holdest that those images</p>
<p>Which come from objects are the sole that flit,</p>
<p>Others indeed there be of own accord</p>
<p>Begot, self-formed in earth's aery skies,</p>
<p>Which, moulded to innumerable shapes,</p>
<p>Are borne aloft, and, fluid as they are,</p>
<p>Cease not to change appearance and to turn</p>
<p>Into new outlines of all sorts of forms;</p>
<p>As we behold the clouds grow thick on high</p>
<p>And smirch the serene vision of the world,</p>
<p>Stroking the air with motions. For oft are seen</p>
<p>The giants' faces flying far along</p>
<p>And trailing a spread of shadow; and at times</p>
<p>The mighty mountains and mountain-sundered rocks</p>
<p>Going before and crossing on the sun,</p>
<p>Whereafter a monstrous beast dragging amain</p>
<p>And leading in the other thunderheads.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="143"/>
<p>Now [hear] how easy and how swift they be</p>
<p>Engendered, and perpetually flow off</p>
<p>From things and gliding pass away....</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>For ever every outside streams away</p>
<p>From off all objects, since discharge they may;</p>
<p>And when this outside reaches other things,</p>
<p>As chiefly glass, it passes through; but where</p>
<p>It reaches the rough rocks or stuff of wood,</p>
<p>There 'tis so rent that it cannot give back</p>
<p>An image. But when gleaming objects dense,</p>
<p>As chiefly mirrors, have been set before it,</p>
<p>Nothing of this sort happens. For it can't</p>
<p>Go, as through glass, nor yet be rent- its safety,</p>
<p>By virtue of that smoothness, being sure.</p>
<p>'Tis therefore that from them the images</p>
<p>Stream back to us; and howso suddenly</p>
<p>Thou place, at any instant, anything</p>
<p>Before a mirror, there an image shows;</p>
<p>Proving that ever from a body's surface</p>
<p>Flow off thin textures and thin shapes of things.</p>
<p>Thus many images in little time</p>
<p>Are gendered; so their origin is named</p>
<p>Rightly a speedy. And even as the sun</p>
<p>Must send below, in little time, to earth</p>
<p>So many beams to keep all things so full</p>
<p>Of light incessant; thus, on grounds the same,</p>
<p>From things there must be borne, in many modes,</p>
<p>To every quarter round, upon the moment,</p>
<p>The many images of things; because</p>
<p>Unto whatever face of things we turn</p>
<p>The mirror, things of form and hue the same</p>
<p>Respond. Besides, though but a moment since</p>
<p>Serenest was the weather of the sky,</p>
<p>So fiercely sudden is it foully thick</p>
<p>That ye might think that round about all murk</p>
<p>Had parted forth from <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> and filled</p>
<p>The mighty vaults of sky- so grievously,</p>
<p>As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome night,</p>
<p>Do faces of black horror hang on high-</p>
<p>Of which how small a part an image is</p>
<p>There's none to tell or reckon out in words.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="176"/>
<p rend="indent">  Now come; with what swift motion they are borne,</p>
<p>These images, and what the speed assigned</p>
<p>To them across the breezes swimming on-</p>
<p>So that o'er lengths of space a little hour</p>
<p>Alone is wasted, toward whatever region</p>
<p>Each with its divers impulse tends- I'll tell</p>
<p>In verses sweeter than they many are;</p>
<p>Even as the swan's slight note is better far</p>
<p>Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes</p>
<p>Among the southwind's aery clouds. And first,</p>
<p>One oft may see that objects which are light</p>
<p>And made of tiny bodies are the swift;</p>
<p>In which class is the sun's light and his heat,</p>
<p>Since made from small primordial elements</p>
<p>Which, as it were, are forward knocked along</p>
<p>And through the interspaces of the air</p>
<p>To pass delay not, urged by blows behind;</p>
<p>For light by light is instantly supplied</p>
<p>And gleam by following gleam is spurred and driven.</p>
<p>Thus likewise must the images have power</p>
<p>Through unimaginable space to speed</p>
<p>Within a point of time,- first, since a cause</p>
<p>Exceeding small there is, which at their back</p>
<p>Far forward drives them and propels, where, too,</p>
<p>They're carried with such winged lightness on;</p>
<p>And, secondly, since furnished, when sent off,</p>
<p>With texture of such rareness that they can</p>
<p>Through objects whatsoever penetrate</p>
<p>And ooze, as 'twere, through intervening air.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="199"/>
<p>Besides, if those fine particles of things</p>
<p>Which from so deep within are sent abroad,</p>
<p>As light and heat of sun, are seen to glide</p>
<p>And spread themselves through all the space of heaven</p>
<p>Upon one instant of the day, and fly</p>
<p>O'er sea and lands and flood the heaven, what then</p>
<p>Of those which on the outside stand prepared,</p>
<p>When they're hurled off with not a thing to check</p>
<p>Their going out? Dost thou not see indeed</p>
<p>How swifter and how farther must they go</p>
<p>And speed through manifold the length of space</p>
<p>In time the same that from the sun the rays</p>
<p>O'erspread the heaven? This also seems to be</p>
<p>Example chief and true with what swift speed</p>
<p>The images of things are borne about:</p>
<p>That soon as ever under open skies</p>
<p>Is spread the shining water, all at once,</p>
<p>If stars be out in heaven, upgleam from earth,</p>
<p>Serene and radiant in the water there,</p>
<p>The constellations of the universe-</p>
<p>Now seest thou not in what a point of time</p>
<p>An image from the shores of ether falls</p>
<p>Unto the shores of earth? Wherefore, again,</p>
<p>And yet again, 'tis needful to confess</p>
<p>With wondrous...</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="217"/>

<p>Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.</p>
<p>From certain things flow odours evermore,</p>
<p>As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray</p>
<p>From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls</p>
<p>Around the coasts. Nor ever cease to flit</p>
<p>The varied voices, sounds athrough the air.</p>
<p>Then too there comes into the mouth at times</p>
<p>The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea</p>
<p>We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch</p>
<p>The wormword being mixed, its bitter stings.</p>
<p>To such degree from all things is each thing</p>
<p>Borne streamingly along, and sent about</p>
<p>To every region round; and nature grants</p>
<p>Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,</p>
<p>Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,</p>
<p>And all the time are suffered to descry</p>
<p>And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="230"/>
<p>Besides, since shape examined by our hands</p>
<p>Within the dark is known to be the same</p>
<p>As that by eyes perceived within the light</p>
<p>And lustrous day, both touch and sight must be</p>
<p>By one like cause aroused. So, if we test</p>
<p>A square and get its stimulus on us</p>
<p>Within the dark, within the light what square</p>
<p>Can fall upon our sight, except a square</p>
<p>That images the things? Wherefore it seems</p>
<p>The source of seeing is in images,</p>
<p>Nor without these can anything be viewed.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Now these same films I name are borne about</p>
<p>And tossed and scattered into regions all.</p>
<p>But since we do perceive alone through eyes,</p>
<p>It follows hence that whitherso we turn</p>
<p>Our sight, all things do strike against it there</p>
<p>With form and hue. And just how far from us</p>
<p>Each thing may be away, the image yields</p>
<p>To us the power to see and chance to tell:</p>
<p>For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead</p>
<p>And drives along the air that's in the space</p>
<p>Betwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air</p>
<p>All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere,</p>
<p>Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise</p>
<p>Passes across. Therefore it comes we see</p>
<p>How far from us each thing may be away,</p>
<p>And the more air there be that's driven before,</p>
<p>And too the longer be the brushing breeze</p>
<p>Against our eyes, the farther off removed</p>
<p>Each thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work</p>
<p>With mightily swift order all goes on,</p>
<p>So that upon one instant we may see</p>
<p>What kind the object and how far away.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Nor over-marvellous must this be deemed</p>
<p>In these affairs that, though the films which strike</p>
<p>Upon the eyes cannot be singly seen,</p>
<p>The things themselves may be perceived. For thus</p>
<p>When the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke</p>
<p>And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our wont</p>
<p>To feel each private particle of wind</p>
<p>Or of that cold, but rather all at once;</p>
<p>And so we see how blows affect our body,</p>
<p>As if one thing were beating on the same</p>
<p>And giving us the feel of its own body</p>
<p>Outside of us. Again, whene'er we thump</p>
<p>With finger-tip upon a stone, we touch</p>
<p>But the rock's surface and the outer hue,</p>
<p>Nor feel that hue by contact- rather feel</p>
<p>The very hardness deep within the rock.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="269"/>
<p rend="indent">  Now come, and why beyond a looking-glass</p>
<p>An image may be seen, perceive. For seen</p>
<p>It soothly is, removed far within.</p>
<p>'Tis the same sort as objects peered upon</p>
<p>Outside in their true shape, whene'er a door</p>
<p>Yields through itself an open peering-place,</p>
<p>And lets us see so many things outside</p>
<p>Beyond the house. Also that sight is made</p>
<p>By a twofold twin air: for first is seen</p>
<p>The air inside the door-posts; next the doors,</p>
<p>The twain to left and right; and afterwards</p>
<p>A light beyond comes brushing through our eyes,</p>
<p>Then other air, then objects peered upon</p>
<p>Outside in their true shape. And thus, when first</p>
<p>The image of the glass projects itself,</p>
<p>As to our gaze it comes, it shoves ahead</p>
<p>And drives along the air that's in the space</p>
<p>Betwixt it and our eyes, and brings to pass</p>
<p>That we perceive the air ere yet the glass.</p>
<p>But when we've also seen the glass itself,</p>
<p>Forthwith that image which from us is borne</p>
<p>Reaches the glass, and there thrown back again</p>
<p>Comes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls</p>
<p>Ahead of itself another air, that then</p>
<p>'Tis this we see before itself, and thus</p>
<p>It looks so far removed behind the glass.</p>
<p>Wherefore again, again, there's naught for wonder</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>In those which render from the mirror's plane</p>
<p>A vision back, since each thing comes to pass</p>
<p>By means of the two airs. Now, in the glass</p>
<p>The right part of our members is observed</p>
<p>Upon the left, because, when comes the image</p>
<p>Hitting against the level of the glass,</p>
<p>'Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off</p>
<p>Backwards in line direct and not oblique,-</p>
<p>Exactly as whoso his plaster-mask</p>
<p>Should dash, before 'twere dry, on post or beam,</p>
<p>And it should straightway keep, at clinging there,</p>
<p>Its shape, reversed, facing him who threw,</p>
<p>And so remould the features it gives back:</p>
<p>It comes that now the right eye is the left,</p>
<p>The left the right.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="302"/><p rend="indent">An image too may be</p>
<p>From mirror into mirror handed on,</p>
<p>Until of idol-films even five or six</p>
<p>Have thus been gendered. For whatever things</p>
<p>Shall hide back yonder in the house, the same,</p>
<p>However far removed in twisting ways,</p>
<p>May still be all brought forth through bending paths</p>
<p>And by these several mirrors seen to be</p>
<p>Within the house, since nature so compels</p>
<p>All things to be borne backward and spring off</p>
<p>At equal angles from all other things.</p>
<p>To such degree the image gleams across</p>
<p>From mirror unto mirror; where 'twas left</p>
<p>It comes to be the right, and then again</p>
<p>Returns and changes round unto the left.</p>
<p>Again, those little sides of mirrors curved</p>
<p>Proportionate to the bulge of our own flank</p>
<p>Send back to us their idols with the right</p>
<p>Upon the right; and this is so because</p>
<p>Either the image is passed on along</p>
<p>From mirror unto mirror, and thereafter,</p>
<p>When twice dashed off, flies back unto ourselves;</p>
<p>Or else the image wheels itself around,</p>
<p>When once unto the mirror it has come,</p>
<p>Since the curved surface teaches it to turn</p>
<p>To usward. Further, thou might'st well believe</p>
<p>That these film-idols step along with us</p>
<p>And set their feet in unison with ours</p>
<p>And imitate our carriage, since from that</p>
<p>Part of a mirror whence thou hast withdrawn</p>
<p>Straightway no images can be returned.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Further, our eye-balls tend to flee the bright</p>
<p>And shun to gaze thereon; the sun even blinds,</p>
<p>If thou goest on to strain them unto him,</p>
<p>Because his strength is mighty, and the films</p>
<p>Heavily downward from on high are borne</p>
<p>Through the pure ether and the viewless winds,</p>
<p>And strike the eyes, disordering their joints.</p>
<p>So piecing lustre often burns the eyes,</p>
<p>Because it holdeth many seeds of fire</p>
<p>Which, working into eyes, engender pain.</p>
<p>Again, whatever jaundiced people view</p>
<p>Becomes wan-yellow, since from out their bodies</p>
<p>Flow many seeds wan-yellow forth to meet</p>
<p>The films of things, and many too are mixed</p>
<p>Within their eye, which by contagion paint</p>
<p>All things with sallowness.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="337"/>
<p rend="indent">Again, we view</p>
<p>From dark recesses things that stand in light,</p>
<p>Because, when first has entered and possessed</p>
<p>The open eyes this nearer darkling air,</p>
<p>Swiftly the shining air and luminous</p>
<p>Followeth in, which purges then the eyes</p>
<p>And scatters asunder of that other air</p>
<p>The sable shadows, for in large degrees</p>
<p>This air is nimbler, nicer, and more strong.</p>
<p>And soon as ever 'thas filled and oped with light</p>
<p>The pathways of the eyeballs, which before</p>
<p>Black air had blocked, there follow straightaway</p>
<p>Those films of things out-standing in the light,</p>
<p>Provoking vision- what we cannot do</p>
<p>From out the light with objects in the dark,</p>
<p>Because that denser darkling air behind</p>
<p>Followeth in, and fills each aperture</p>
<p>And thus blockades the pathways of the eyes</p>
<p>That there no images of any things</p>
<p>Can be thrown in and agitate the eyes.</p>
<p rend="indent">  And when from far away we do behold</p>
<p>The squared towers of a city, oft</p>
<p>Rounded they seem,- on this account because</p>
<p>Each distant angle is perceived obtuse,</p>
<p>Or rather it is not perceived at all;</p>
<p>And perishes its blow nor to our gaze</p>
<p>Arrives its stroke, since through such length of air</p>
<p>Are borne along the idols that the air</p>
<p>Makes blunt the idol of the angle's point</p>
<p>By numerous collidings. When thuswise</p>
<p>The angles of the tower each and all</p>
<p>Have quite escaped the sense, the stones appear</p>
<p>As rubbed and rounded on a turner's wheel-</p>
<p>Yet not like objects near and truly round,</p>
<p>But with a semblance to them, shadowily.</p>
<p>Likewise, our shadow in the sun appears</p>
<p>To move along and follow our own steps</p>
<p>And imitate our carriage- if thou thinkest</p>
<p>Air that is thus bereft of light can walk,</p>
<p>Following the gait and motion of mankind.</p>
<p>For what we use to name a shadow, sure</p>
<p>Is naught but air deprived of light. No marvel:</p>
<p>Because the earth from spot to spot is reft</p>
<p>Progressively of light of sun, whenever</p>
<p>In moving round we get within its way,</p>
<p>While any spot of earth by us abandoned</p>
<p>Is filled with light again, on this account</p>
<p>It comes to pass that what was body's shadow</p>
<p>Seems still the same to follow after us</p>
<p>In one straight course. Since, evermore pour in</p>
<p>New lights of rays, and perish then the old,</p>
<p>Just like the wool that's drawn into the flame.</p>
<p>Therefore the earth is easily spoiled of light</p>
<p>And easily refilled and from herself</p>
<p>Washeth the black shadows quite away.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="379"/>
<p rend="indent">  And yet in this we don't at all concede</p>
<p>That eyes be cheated. For their task it is</p>
<p>To note in whatsoever place be light,</p>
<p>In what be shadow: whether or no the gleams</p>
<p>Be still the same, and whether the shadow which</p>
<p>Just now was here is that one passing thither,</p>
<p>Or whether the facts be what we said above,</p>
<p>'Tis after all the reasoning of mind</p>
<p>That must decide; nor can our eyeballs know</p>
<p>The nature of reality. And so</p>
<p>Attach thou not this fault of mind to eyes,</p>
<p>Nor lightly think our senses everywhere</p>
<p>Are tottering. The ship in which we sail</p>
<p>Is borne along, although it seems to stand;</p>
<p>The ship that bides in roadstead is supposed</p>
<p>There to be passing by. And hills and fields</p>
<p>Seem fleeing fast astern, past which we urge</p>
<p>The ship and fly under the bellying sails.</p>
<p>The stars, each one, do seem to pause, affixed</p>
<p>To the ethereal caverns, though they all</p>
<p>Forever are in motion, rising out</p>
<p>And thence revisiting their far descents</p>
<p>When they have measured with their bodies bright</p>
<p>The span of heaven. And likewise sun and moon</p>
<p>Seem biding in a roadstead,- objects which,</p>
<p>As plain fact proves, are really borne along.</p>
<p>Between two mountains far away aloft</p>
<p>From midst the whirl of waters open lies</p>
<p>A gaping exit for the fleet, and yet</p>
<p>They seem conjoined in a single isle.</p>
<p>When boys themselves have stopped their spinning round,</p>
<p>The halls still seem to whirl and posts to reel,</p>
<p>Until they now must almost think the roofs</p>
<p>Threaten to ruin down upon their heads.</p>
<p>And now, when nature begins to lift on high</p>
<p>The sun's red splendour and the tremulous fires,</p>
<p>And raise him o'er the mountain-tops, those mountains-</p>
<p>O'er which he seemeth then to thee to be,</p>
<p>His glowing self hard by atingeing them</p>
<p>With his own fire- are yet away from us</p>
<p>Scarcely two thousand arrow-shots, indeed</p>
<p>Oft scarce five hundred courses of a dart;</p>
<p>Although between those mountains and the sun</p>
<p>Lie the huge plains of ocean spread beneath</p>
<p>The vasty shores of ether, and intervene</p>
<p>A thousand lands, possessed by many a folk</p>
<p>And generations of wild beasts. Again,</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="414"/>
<p>A pool of water of but a finger's depth,</p>
<p>Which lies between the stones along the pave,</p>
<p>Offers a vision downward into earth</p>
<p>As far, as from the earth o'erspread on high</p>
<p>The gulfs of heaven; that thus thou seemest to view</p>
<p>Clouds down below and heavenly bodies plunged</p>
<p>Wondrously in heaven under earth.</p>
<p>Then too, when in the middle of the stream</p>
<p>Sticks fast our dashing horse, and down we gaze</p>
<p>Into the river's rapid waves, some force</p>
<p>Seems then to bear the body of the horse,</p>
<p>Though standing still, reversely from his course,</p>
<p>And swiftly push up-stream. And wheresoe'er</p>
<p>We cast our eyes across, all objects seem</p>
<p>Thus to be onward borne and flow along</p>
<p>In the same way as we. A portico,</p>
<p>Albeit it stands well propped from end to end</p>
<p>On equal columns, parallel and big,</p>
<p>Contracts by stages in a narrow cone,</p>
<p>When from one end the long, long whole is seen,-</p>
<p>Until, conjoining ceiling with the floor,</p>
<p>And the whole right side with the left, it draws</p>
<p>Together to a cone's nigh-viewless point.</p>
<p>To sailors on the main the sun he seems</p>
<p>From out the waves to rise, and in the waves</p>
<p>To set and bury his light- because indeed</p>
<p>They gaze on naught but water and the sky.</p>
<p>Again, to gazers ignorant of the sea,</p>
<p>Vessels in port seem, as with broken poops,</p>
<p>To lean upon the water, quite agog;</p>
<p>For any portion of the oars that's raised</p>
<p>Above the briny spray is straight, and straight</p>
<p>The rudders from above. But other parts,</p>
<p>Those sunk, immersed below the water-line,</p>
<p>Seem broken all and bended and inclined</p>
<p>Sloping to upwards, and turned back to float</p>
<p>Almost atop the water. And when the winds</p>
<p>Carry the scattered drifts along the sky</p>
<p>In the night-time, then seem to glide along</p>
<p>The radiant constellations 'gainst the clouds</p>
<p>And there on high to take far other course</p>
<p>From that whereon in truth they're borne. And then,</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="447"/>
<p>If haply our hand be set beneath one eye</p>
<p>And press below thereon, then to our gaze</p>
<p>Each object which we gaze on seems to be,</p>
<p>By some sensation twain- then twain the lights</p>
<p>Of lampions burgeoning in flowers of flame,</p>
<p>And twain the furniture in all the house,</p>
<p>Two-fold the visages of fellow-men,</p>
<p>And twain their bodies. And again, when sleep</p>
<p>Has bound our members down in slumber soft</p>
<p>And all the body lies in deep repose,</p>
<p>Yet then we seem to self to be awake</p>
<p>And move our members; and in night's blind gloom</p>
<p>We think to mark the daylight and the sun;</p>
<p>And, shut within a room, yet still we seem</p>
<p>To change our skies, our oceans, rivers, hills,</p>
<p>To cross the plains afoot, and hear new sounds,</p>
<p>Though still the austere silence of the night</p>
<p>Abides around us, and to speak replies,</p>
<p>Though voiceless. Other cases of the sort</p>
<p>Wondrously many do we see, which all</p>
<p>Seek, so to say, to injure faith in sense-</p>
<p>In vain, because the largest part of these</p>
<p>Deceives through mere opinions of the mind,</p>
<p>Which we do add ourselves, feigning to see</p>
<p>What by the senses are not seen at all.</p>
<p>For naught is harder than to separate</p>
<p>Plain facts from dubious, which the mind forthwith</p>
<p>Adds by itself.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="469"/>
<p rend="indent">                  Again, if one suppose</p>
<p>That naught is known, he knows not whether this</p>
<p>Itself is able to be known, since he</p>
<p>Confesses naught to know. Therefore with him</p>
<p>I waive discussion- who has set his head</p>
<p>Even where his feet should be. But let me grant</p>
<p>That this he knows,- I question: whence he knows</p>
<p>What 'tis to know and not-to-know in turn,</p>
<p>And what created concept of the truth,</p>
<p>And what device has proved the dubious</p>
<p>To differ from the certain?- since in things</p>
<p>He's heretofore seen naught of true. Thou'lt find</p>
<p>That from the senses first hath been create</p>
<p>Concept of truth, nor can the senses be</p>
<p>Rebutted. For criterion must be found</p>
<p>Worthy of greater trust, which shall defeat</p>
<p>Through own authority the false by true;</p>
<p>What, then, than these our senses must there be</p>
<p>Worthy a greater trust? Shall reason, sprung</p>
<p>From some false sense, prevail to contradict</p>
<p>Those senses, sprung as reason wholly is</p>
<p>From out the senses?- For lest these be true,</p>
<p>All reason also then is falsified.</p>
<p>Or shall the ears have power to blame the eyes,</p>
<p>Or yet the touch the ears? Again, shall taste</p>
<p>Accuse this touch or shall the nose confute</p>
<p>Or eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is:</p>
<p>For unto each has been divided off</p>
<p>Its function quite apart, its power to each;</p>
<p>And thus we're still constrained to perceive</p>
<p>The soft, the cold, the hot apart, apart</p>
<p>All divers hues and whatso things there be</p>
<p>Conjoined with hues. Likewise the tasting tongue</p>
<p>Has its own power apart, and smells apart</p>
<p>And sounds apart are known. And thus it is</p>
<p>That no one sense can e'er convict another.</p>
<p>Nor shall one sense have power to blame itself,</p>
<p>Because it always must be deemed the same,</p>
<p>Worthy of equal trust. And therefore what</p>
<p>At any time unto these senses showed,</p>
<p>The same is true.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="500"/><p rend="indent">And if the reason be</p>
<p>Unable to unravel us the cause</p>
<p>Why objects, which at hand were square, afar</p>
<p>Seemed rounded, yet it more availeth us,</p>
<p>Lacking the reason, to pretend a cause</p>
<p>For each configuration, than to let</p>
<p>From out our hands escape the obvious things</p>
<p>And injure primal faith in sense, and wreck</p>
<p>All those foundations upon which do rest</p>
<p>Our life and safety. For not only reason</p>
<p>Would topple down; but even our very life</p>
<p>Would straightaway collapse, unless we dared</p>
<p>To trust our senses and to keep away</p>
<p>From headlong heights and places to be shunned</p>
<p>Of a like peril, and to seek with speed</p>
<p>Their opposites! Again, as in a building,</p>
<p>If the first plumb-line be askew, and if</p>
<p>The square deceiving swerve from lines exact,</p>
<p>And if the level waver but the least</p>
<p>In any part, the whole construction then</p>
<p>Must turn out faulty- shelving and askew,</p>
<p>Leaning to back and front, incongruous,</p>
<p>That now some portions seem about to fall,</p>
<p>And falls the whole ere long- betrayed indeed</p>
<p>By first deceiving estimates: so too</p>
<p>Thy calculations in affairs of life</p>
<p>Must be askew and false, if sprung for thee</p>
<p>From senses false. So all that troop of words</p>
<p>Marshalled against the senses is quite vain.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="522"/>
<p rend="indent">  And now remains to demonstrate with ease</p>
<p>How other senses each their things perceive.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,</p>
<p>When, getting into ears, they strike the sense</p>
<p>With their own body. For confess we must</p>
<p>Even voice and sound to be corporeal,</p>
<p>Because they're able on the sense to strike.</p>
<p>Besides voice often scrapes against the throat,</p>
<p>And screams in going out do make more rough</p>
<p>The wind-pipe- naturally enough, methinks,</p>
<p>When, through the narrow exit rising up</p>
<p>In larger throng, these primal germs of voice</p>
<p>Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,</p>
<p>Also the door of the mouth is scraped against</p>
<p>[By air blown outward] from distended [cheeks].</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>And thus no doubt there is, that voice and words</p>
<p>Consist of elements corporeal,</p>
<p>With power to pain. Nor art thou unaware</p>
<p>Likewise how much of body's ta'en away,</p>
<p>How much from very thews and powers of men</p>
<p>May be withdrawn by steady talk, prolonged</p>
<p>Even from the rising splendour of the morn</p>
<p>To shadows of black evening,- above all</p>
<p>If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.</p>
<p>Therefore the voice must be corporeal,</p>
<p>Since the long talker loses from his frame</p>
<p>A part.</p>
<p rend="indent">        Moreover, roughness in the sound</p>
<p>Comes from the roughness in the primal germs,</p>
<p>As a smooth sound from smooth ones is create;</p>
<p>Nor have these elements a form the same</p>
<p>When the trump rumbles with a hollow roar,</p>
<p>As when barbaric Berecynthian pipe</p>
<p>Buzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans</p>
<p>By night from icy shores of Helicon</p>
<p>With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="549"/>
<p rend="indent">  Thus, when from deep within our frame we force</p>
<p>These voices, and at mouth expel them forth,</p>
<p>The mobile tongue, artificer of words,</p>
<p>Makes them articulate, and too the lips</p>
<p>By their formations share in shaping them.</p>
<p>Hence when the space is short from starting-point</p>
<p>To where that voice arrives, the very words</p>
<p>Must too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.</p>
<p>For then the voice conserves its own formation,</p>
<p>Conserves its shape. But if the space between</p>
<p>Be longer than is fit, the words must be</p>
<p>Through the much air confounded, and the voice</p>
<p>Disordered in its flight across the winds-</p>
<p>And so it haps, that thou canst sound perceive,</p>
<p>Yet not determine what the words may mean;</p>
<p>To such degree confounded and encumbered</p>
<p>The voice approaches us. Again, one word,</p>
<p>Sent from the crier's mouth, may rouse all ears</p>
<p>Among the populace. And thus one voice</p>
<p>Scatters asunder into many voices,</p>
<p>Since it divides itself for separate ears,</p>
<p>Imprinting form of word and a clear tone.</p>
<p>But whatso part of voices fails to hit</p>
<p>The ears themselves perishes, borne beyond,</p>
<p>Idly diffused among the winds. A part,</p>
<p>Beating on solid porticoes, tossed back</p>
<p>Returns a sound; and sometimes mocks the ear</p>
<p>With a mere phantom of a word. </p>
<milestone unit="card" n="572"/>
<p rend="indent">  When this</p>
<p>Thou well hast noted, thou canst render count</p>
<p>Unto thyself and others why it is</p>
<p>Along the lonely places that the rocks</p>
<p>Give back like shapes of words in order like,</p>
<p>When search we after comrades wandering</p>
<p>Among the shady mountains, and aloud</p>
<p>Call unto them, the scattered. I have seen</p>
<p>Spots that gave back even voices six or seven</p>
<p>For one thrown forth- for so the very hills,</p>
<p>Dashing them back against the hills, kept on</p>
<p>With their reverberations. And these spots</p>
<p>The neighbouring country-side doth feign to be</p>
<p>Haunts of the goat-foot satyrs and the nymphs;</p>
<p>And tells ye there be fauns, by whose night noise</p>
<p>And antic revels yonder they declare</p>
<p>The voiceless silences are broken oft,</p>
<p>And tones of strings are made and wailings sweet</p>
<p>Which the pipe, beat by players' finger-tips,</p>
<p>Pours out; and far and wide the farmer-race</p>
<p>Begins to hear, when, shaking the garmentings</p>
<p>Of pine upon his half-beast head, god-Pan</p>
<p>With puckered lip oft runneth o'er and o'er</p>
<p>The open reeds,- lest flute should cease to pour</p>
<p>The woodland music! Other prodigies</p>
<p>And wonders of this ilk they love to tell,</p>
<p>Lest they be thought to dwell in lonely spots</p>
<p>And even by gods deserted. This is why</p>
<p>They boast of marvels in their story-tellings;</p>
<p>Or by some other reason are led on-</p>
<p>Greedy, as all mankind hath ever been,</p>
<p>To prattle fables into ears.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="595"/>
<p rend="indent"> Again,</p>
<p>One need not wonder how it comes about</p>
<p>That through those places (through which eyes cannot</p>
<p>View objects manifest) sounds yet may pass</p>
<p>And assail the ears. For often we observe</p>
<p>People conversing, though the doors be closed;</p>
<p>No marvel either, since all voice unharmed</p>
<p>Can wind through bended apertures of things,</p>
<p>While idol-films decline to- for they're rent,</p>
<p>Unless along straight apertures they swim,</p>
<p>Like those in glass, through which all images</p>
<p>Do fly across. And yet this voice itself,</p>
<p>In passing through shut chambers of a house,</p>
<p>Is dulled, and in a jumble enters ears,</p>
<p>And sound we seem to hear far more than words.</p>
<p>Moreover, a voice is into all directions</p>
<p>Divided up, since off from one another</p>
<p>New voices are engendered, when one voice</p>
<p>Hath once leapt forth, outstarting into many-</p>
<p>As oft a spark of fire is wont to sprinkle</p>
<p>Itself into its several fires. And so,</p>
<p>Voices do fill those places hid behind,</p>
<p>Which all are in a hubbub round about,</p>
<p>Astir with sound. But idol-films do tend,</p>
<p>As once sent forth, in straight directions all;</p>
<p>Wherefore one can inside a wall see naught,</p>
<p>Yet catch the voices from beyond the same.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="615"/>
<p rend="indent">  Nor tongue and palate, whereby we flavour feel,</p>
<p>Present more problems for more work of thought.</p>
<p>Firstly, we feel a flavour in the mouth,</p>
<p>When forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,-</p>
<p>As any one perchance begins to squeeze</p>
<p>With hand and dry a sponge with water soaked.</p>
<p>Next, all which forth we squeeze is spread about</p>
<p>Along the pores and intertwined paths</p>
<p>Of the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth</p>
<p>The bodies of the oozy flavour, then</p>
<p>Delightfully they touch, delightfully</p>
<p>They treat all spots, around the wet and trickling</p>
<p>Enclosures of the tongue. And contrariwise,</p>
<p>They sting and pain the sense with their assault,</p>
<p>According as with roughness they're supplied.</p>
<p>Next, only up to palate is the pleasure</p>
<p>Coming from flavour; for in truth when down</p>
<p>'Thas plunged along the throat, no pleasure is,</p>
<p>Whilst into all the frame it spreads around;</p>
<p>Nor aught it matters with what food is fed</p>
<p>The body, if only what thou take thou canst</p>
<p>Distribute well digested to the frame</p>
<p>And keep the stomach in a moist career.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Now, how it is we see some food for some,</p>
<p>Others for others....</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>I will unfold, or wherefore what to some</p>
<p>Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others</p>
<p>Can seem delectable to eat,- why here</p>
<p>So great the distance and the difference is</p>
<p>That what is food to one to some becomes</p>
<p>Fierce poison, as a certain snake there is</p>
<p>Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste</p>
<p>And end itself by gnawing up its coil.</p>
<p>Again, fierce poison is the hellebore</p>
<p>To us, but puts the fat on goats and quails.</p>
<p>That thou mayst know by what devices this</p>
<p>Is brought about, in chief thou must recall</p>
<p>What we have said before, that seeds are kept</p>
<p>Commixed in things in divers modes. Again,</p>
<p>As all the breathing creatures which take food</p>
<p>Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut</p>
<p>And contour of their members bounds them round,</p>
<p>Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist</p>
<p>Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,</p>
<p>Since seeds do differ, divers too must be</p>
<p>The interstices and paths (which we do call</p>
<p>The apertures) in all the members, even</p>
<p>In mouth and palate too. Thus some must be</p>
<p>More small or yet more large, three-cornered some</p>
<p>And others squared, and many others round,</p>
<p>And certain of them many-angled too</p>
<p>In many modes. For, as the combination</p>
<p>And motion of their divers shapes demand,</p>
<p>The shapes of apertures must be diverse</p>
<p>And paths must vary according to their walls</p>
<p>That bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some,</p>
<p>Becomes to others bitter, for him to whom</p>
<p>'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs</p>
<p>Have entered caressingly the palate's pores.</p>
<p>And, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet</p>
<p>Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt</p>
<p>The rough and barbed particles have got</p>
<p>Into the narrows of the apertures.</p>
<p>Now easy it is from these affairs to know</p>
<p>Whatever...</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Indeed, where one from o'er-abundant bile</p>
<p>Is stricken with fever, or in other wise</p>
<p>Feels the roused violence of some malady,</p>
<p>There the whole frame is now upset, and there</p>
<p>All the positions of the seeds are changed,-</p>
<p>So that the bodies which before were fit</p>
<p>To cause the savour, now are fit no more,</p>
<p>And now more apt are others which be able</p>
<p>To get within the pores and gender sour.</p>
<p>Both sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey-</p>
<p>What oft we've proved above to thee before.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="673"/>
<p>Now come, and I will indicate what wise</p>
<p>Impact of odour on the nostrils touches.</p>
<p>And first, 'tis needful there be many things</p>
<p>From whence the streaming flow of varied odours</p>
<p>May roll along, and we're constrained to think</p>
<p>They stream and dart and sprinkle themselves about</p>
<p>Impartially. But for some breathing creatures</p>
<p>One odour is more apt, to others another-</p>
<p>Because of differing forms of seeds and pores.</p>
<p>Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees</p>
<p>Are led by odour of honey, vultures too</p>
<p>By carcasses. Again, the forward power</p>
<p>Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on</p>
<p>Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast</p>
<p>Hath hastened its career; and the white goose,</p>
<p>The saviour of the Roman citadel,</p>
<p>Forescents afar the odour of mankind.</p>
<p>Thus, diversly to divers ones is given</p>
<p>Peculiar smell that leadeth each along</p>
<p>To his own food or makes him start aback</p>
<p>From loathsome poison, and in this wise are</p>
<p>The generations of the wild preserved.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Yet is this pungence not alone in odours</p>
<p>Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise,</p>
<p>The look of things and hues agree not all</p>
<p>So well with senses unto all, but that</p>
<p>Some unto some will be, to gaze upon,</p>
<p>More keen and painful. Lo, the raving lions,</p>
<p>They dare not face and gaze upon the cock</p>
<p>Who's wont with wings to flap away the night</p>
<p>From off the stage, and call the beaming morn</p>
<p>With clarion voice- and lions straightway thus</p>
<p>Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,</p>
<p>Within the body of the cocks there be</p>
<p>Some certain seeds, which, into lions' eyes</p>
<p>Injected, bore into the pupils deep</p>
<p>And yield such piercing pain they can't hold out</p>
<p>Against the cocks, however fierce they be-</p>
<p>Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least,</p>
<p>Either because they do not penetrate,</p>
<p>Or since they have free exit from the eyes</p>
<p>As soon as penetrating, so that thus</p>
<p>They cannot hurt our eyes in any part</p>
<p>By there remaining.</p>
<p rend="indent">                     To speak once more of odour;</p>
<p>Whatever assail the nostrils, some can travel</p>
<p>A longer way than others. None of them,</p>
<p>However, 's borne so far as sound or voice-</p>
<p>While I omit all mention of such things</p>
<p>As hit the eyesight and assail the vision.</p>
<p>For slowly on a wandering course it comes</p>
<p>And perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed</p>
<p>Easily into all the winds of air;-</p>
<p>And first, because from deep inside the thing</p>
<p>It is discharged with labour (for the fact</p>
<p>That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground,</p>
<p>Or crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger</p>
<p>Is sign that odours flow and part away</p>
<p>From inner regions of the things). And next,</p>
<p>Thou mayest see that odour is create</p>
<p>Of larger primal germs than voice, because</p>
<p>It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough</p>
<p>Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne;</p>
<p>Wherefore, besides, thou wilt observe 'tis not</p>
<p>So easy to trace out in whatso place</p>
<p>The smelling object is. For, dallying on</p>
<p>Along the winds, the particles cool off,</p>
<p>And then the scurrying messengers of things</p>
<p>Arrive our senses, when no longer hot.</p>
<p>So dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="722"/>
<p rend="indent">  Now mark, and hear what objects move the mind,</p>
<p>And learn, in few, whence unto intellect</p>
<p>Do come what come. And first I tell thee this:</p>
<p>That many images of objects rove</p>
<p>In many modes to every region round-</p>
<p>So thin that easily the one with other,</p>
<p>When once they meet, uniteth in mid-air,</p>
<p>Like gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed,</p>
<p>Far thinner are they in their fabric than</p>
<p>Those images which take a hold on eyes</p>
<p>And smite the vision, since through body's pores</p>
<p>They penetrate, and inwardly stir up</p>
<p>The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.</p>
<p>Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus</p>
<p>The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,</p>
<p>And images of people gone before-</p>
<p>Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;</p>
<p>Because the images of every kind</p>
<p>Are everywhere about us borne- in part</p>
<p>Those which are gendered in the very air</p>
<p>Of own accord, in part those others which</p>
<p>From divers things do part away, and those</p>
<p>Which are compounded, made from out their shapes.</p>
<p>For soothly from no living Centaur is</p>
<p>That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast</p>
<p>Like him was ever; but, when images</p>
<p>Of horse and man by chance have come together,</p>
<p>They easily cohere, as aforesaid,</p>
<p>At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.</p>
<p>In the same fashion others of this ilk</p>
<p>Created are. And when they're quickly borne</p>
<p>In their exceeding lightness, easily</p>
<p>(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,</p>
<p>Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind,</p>
<p>Itself so subtle and so strangely quick.</p>
<p rend="indent">  That these things come to pass as I record,</p>
<p>From this thou easily canst understand:</p>
<p>So far as one is unto other like,</p>
<p>Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes</p>
<p>Must come to pass in fashion not unlike.</p>
<p>Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive</p>
<p>Haply a lion through those idol-films</p>
<p>Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know</p>
<p>Also the mind is in like manner moved,</p>
<p>And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see</p>
<p>(Except that it perceives more subtle films)</p>
<p>The lion and aught else through idol-films.</p>
<p>And when the sleep has overset our frame,</p>
<p>The mind's intelligence is now awake,</p>
<p>Still for no other reason, save that these-</p>
<p>The self-same films as when we are awake-</p>
<p>Assail our minds, to such degree indeed</p>
<p>That we do seem to see for sure the man</p>
<p>Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained</p>
<p>Dominion over. And nature forces this</p>
<p>To come to pass because the body's senses</p>
<p>Are resting, thwarted through the members all,</p>
<p>Unable now to conquer false with true;</p>
<p>And memory lies prone and languishes</p>
<p>In slumber, nor protests that he, the man</p>
<p>Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since</p>
<p>Hath been the gain of death and dissolution.</p>
<p rend="indent">  And further, 'tis no marvel idols move</p>
<p>And toss their arms and other members round</p>
<p>In rhythmic time- and often in men's sleeps</p>
<p>It haps an image this is seen to do;</p>
<p>In sooth, when perishes the former image,</p>
<p>And other is gendered of another pose,</p>
<p>That former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</p>
<p>Of course the change must be conceived as speedy;</p>
<p>So great the swiftness and so great the store</p>
<p>Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief</p>
<p>As mind can mark) so great, again, the store</p>
<p>Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies.</p>
<p rend="indent">  It happens also that there is supplied</p>
<p>Sometimes an image not of kind the same;</p>
<p>But what before was woman, now at hand</p>
<p>Is seen to stand there, altered into male;</p>
<p>Or other visage, other age succeeds;</p>
<p>But slumber and oblivion take care</p>
<p>That we shall feel no wonder at the thing.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="777"/>
<p rend="indent">  And much in these affairs demands inquiry,</p>
<p>And much, illumination- if we crave</p>
<p>With plainness to exhibit facts. And first,</p>
<p>Why doth the mind of one to whom the whim</p>
<p>To think has come behold forthwith that thing?</p>
<p>Or do the idols watch upon our will,</p>
<p>And doth an image unto us occur,</p>
<p>Directly we desire- if heart prefer</p>
<p>The sea, the land, or after all the sky?</p>
<p>Assemblies of the citizens, parades,</p>
<p>Banquets, and battles, these and all doth she,</p>
<p>Nature, create and furnish at our word?-</p>
<p>Maugre the fact that in same place and spot</p>
<p>Another's mind is meditating things</p>
<p>All far unlike. And what, again, of this:</p>
<p>When we in sleep behold the idols step,</p>
<p>In measure, forward, moving supple limbs,</p>
<p>Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn</p>
<p>With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads</p>
<p>Repeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?</p>
<p>Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,</p>
<p>And wander to and fro well taught indeed,-</p>
<p>Thus to be able in the time of night</p>
<p>To make such games! Or will the truth be this:</p>
<p>Because in one least moment that we mark-</p>
<p>That is, the uttering of a single sound-</p>
<p>There lurk yet many moments, which the reason</p>
<p>Discovers to exist, therefore it comes</p>
<p>That, in a moment how so brief ye will,</p>
<p>The divers idols are hard by, and ready</p>
<p>Each in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,</p>
<p>So great, again, the store of idol-things,</p>
<p>And so, when perishes the former image,</p>
<p>And other is gendered of another pose,</p>
<p>The former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</p>
<p>And since they be so tenuous, mind can mark</p>
<p>Sharply alone the ones it strains to see;</p>
<p>And thus the rest do perish one and all,</p>
<p>Save those for which the mind prepares itself.</p>
<p>Further, it doth prepare itself indeed,</p>
<p>And hopes to see what follows after each-</p>
<p>Hence this result. For hast thou not observed</p>
<p>How eyes, essaying to perceive the fine,</p>
<p>Will strain in preparation, otherwise</p>
<p>Unable sharply to perceive at all?</p>
<p>Yet know thou canst that, even in objects plain,</p>
<p>If thou attendest not, 'tis just the same</p>
<p>As if 'twere all the time removed and far.</p>
<p>What marvel, then, that mind doth lose the rest,</p>
<p>Save those to which 'thas given up itself?</p>
<p>So 'tis that we conjecture from small signs</p>
<p>Things wide and weighty, and involve ourselves</p>
<p>In snarls of self-deceit.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="823"/>

<p rend="indent">                           In these affairs</p>
<p>We crave that thou wilt passionately flee</p>
<p>The one offence, and anxiously wilt shun</p>
<p>The error of presuming the clear lights</p>
<p>Of eyes created were that we might see;</p>
<p>Or thighs and knees, aprop upon the feet,</p>
<p>Thuswise can bended be, that we might step</p>
<p>With goodly strides ahead; or forearms joined</p>
<p>Unto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands</p>
<p>On either side were given, that we might do</p>
<p>Life's own demands. All such interpretation</p>
<p>Is aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning,</p>
<p>Since naught is born in body so that we</p>
<p>May use the same, but birth engenders use:</p>
<p>No seeing ere the lights of eyes were born,</p>
<p>No speaking ere the tongue created was;</p>
<p>But origin of tongue came long before</p>
<p>Discourse of words, and ears created were</p>
<p>Much earlier than any sound was heard;</p>
<p>And all the members, so meseems, were there</p>
<p>Before they got their use: and therefore, they</p>
<p>Could not be gendered for the sake of use.</p>
<p>But contrariwise, contending in the fight</p>
<p>With hand to hand, and rending of the joints,</p>
<p>And fouling of the limbs with gore, was there,</p>
<p>O long before the gleaming spears ere flew;</p>
<p>And nature prompted man to shun a wound,</p>
<p>Before the left arm by the aid of art</p>
<p>Opposed the shielding targe. And, verily,</p>
<p>Yielding the weary body to repose,</p>
<p>Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds,</p>
<p>And quenching thirst is earlier than cups.</p>
<p>These objects, therefore, which for use and life</p>
<p>Have been devised, can be conceived as found</p>
<p>For sake of using. But apart from such</p>
<p>Are all which first were born and afterwards</p>
<p>Gave knowledge of their own utility-</p>
<p>Chief in which sort we note the senses, limbs:</p>
<p>Wherefore, again, 'tis quite beyond thy power</p>
<p>To hold that these could thus have been create</p>
<p>For office of utility.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="858"/>
<p rend="indent">                        Likewise,</p>
<p>'Tis nothing strange that all the breathing creatures</p>
<p>Seek, even by nature of their frame, their food.</p>
<p>Yes, since I've taught thee that from off the things</p>
<p>Stream and depart innumerable bodies</p>
<p>In modes innumerable too; but most</p>
<p>Must be the bodies streaming from the living-</p>
<p>Which bodies, vexed by motion evermore,</p>
<p>Are through the mouth exhaled innumerable,</p>
<p>When weary creatures pant, or through the sweat</p>
<p>Squeezed forth innumerable from deep within.</p>
<p>Thus body rarefies, so undermined</p>
<p>In all its nature, and pain attends its state.</p>
<p>And so the food is taken to underprop</p>
<p>The tottering joints, and by its interfusion</p>
<p>To re-create their powers, and there stop up</p>
<p>The longing, open-mouthed through limbs and veins,</p>
<p>For eating. And the moist no less departs</p>
<p>Into all regions that demand the moist;</p>
<p>And many heaped-up particles of hot,</p>
<p>Which cause such burnings in these bellies of ours,</p>
<p>The liquid on arriving dissipates</p>
<p>And quenches like a fire, that parching heat</p>
<p>No longer now can scorch the frame. And so,</p>
<p>Thou seest how panting thirst is washed away</p>
<p>From off our body, how the hunger-pang</p>
<p>It, too, appeased.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="877"/>
<p rend="indent">                     Now, how it comes that we,</p>
<p>Whene'er we wish, can step with strides ahead,</p>
<p>And how 'tis given to move our limbs about,</p>
<p>And what device is wont to push ahead</p>
<p>This the big load of our corporeal frame,</p>
<p>I'll say to thee- do thou attend what's said.</p>
<p>I say that first some idol-films of walking</p>
<p>Into our mind do fall and smite the mind,</p>
<p>As said before. Thereafter will arises;</p>
<p>For no one starts to do a thing, before</p>
<p>The intellect previsions what it wills;</p>
<p>And what it there pre-visioneth depends</p>
<p>On what that image is. When, therefore, mind</p>
<p>Doth so bestir itself that it doth will</p>
<p>To go and step along, it strikes at once</p>
<p>That energy of soul that's sown about</p>
<p>In all the body through the limbs and frame-</p>
<p>And this is easy of performance, since</p>
<p>The soul is close conjoined with the mind.</p>
<p>Next, soul in turn strikes body, and by degrees</p>
<p>Thus the whole mass is pushed along and moved.</p>
<p>Then too the body rarefies, and air,</p>
<p>Forsooth as ever of such nimbleness,</p>
<p>Comes on and penetrates aboundingly</p>
<p>Through opened pores, and thus is sprinkled round</p>
<p>Unto all smallest places in our frame.</p>
<p>Thus then by these twain factors, severally,</p>
<p>Body is borne like ship with oars and wind.</p>
<p>Nor yet in these affairs is aught for wonder</p>
<p>That particles so fine can whirl around</p>
<p>So great a body and turn this weight of ours;</p>
<p>For wind, so tenuous with its subtle body,</p>
<p>Yet pushes, driving on the mighty ship</p>
<p>Of mighty bulk; one hand directs the same,</p>
<p>Whatever its momentum, and one helm</p>
<p>Whirls it around, whither ye please; and loads,</p>
<p>Many and huge, are moved and hoisted high</p>
<p>By enginery of pulley-blocks and wheels,</p>
<p>With but light strain.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="907"/>
<p rend="indent">                    Now, by what modes this sleep</p>
<p>Pours through our members waters of repose</p>
<p>And frees the breast from cares of mind, I'll tell</p>
<p>In verses sweeter than they many are;</p>
<p>Even as the swan's slight note is better far</p>
<p>Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes</p>
<p>Among the southwind's aery clouds. Do thou</p>
<p>Give me sharp ears and a sagacious mind,-</p>
<p>That thou mayst not deny the things to be</p>
<p>Whereof I'm speaking, nor depart away</p>
<p>With bosom scorning these the spoken truths,</p>
<p>Thyself at fault unable to perceive.</p>
<p>Sleep chiefly comes when energy of soul</p>
<p>Hath now been scattered through the frame, and part</p>
<p>Expelled abroad and gone away, and part</p>
<p>Crammed back and settling deep within the frame-</p>
<p>Whereafter then our loosened members droop.</p>
<p>For doubt is none that by the work of soul</p>
<p>Exist in us this sense, and when by slumber</p>
<p>That sense is thwarted, we are bound to think</p>
<p>The soul confounded and expelled abroad-</p>
<p>Yet not entirely, else the frame would lie</p>
<p>Drenched in the everlasting cold of death.</p>
<p>In sooth, where no one part of soul remained</p>
<p>Lurking among the members, even as fire</p>
<p>Lurks buried under many ashes, whence</p>
<p>Could sense amain rekindled be in members,</p>
<p>As flame can rise anew from unseen fire?</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="929"/>
<p rend="indent">  By what devices this strange state and new</p>
<p>May be occasioned, and by what the soul</p>
<p>Can be confounded and the frame grow faint,</p>
<p>I will untangle: see to it, thou, that I</p>
<p>Pour forth my words not unto empty winds.</p>
<p>In first place, body on its outer parts-</p>
<p>Since these are touched by neighbouring aery gusts-</p>
<p>Must there be thumped and strook by blows of air</p>
<p>Repeatedly. And therefore almost all</p>
<p>Are covered either with hides, or else with shells,</p>
<p>Or with the horny callus, or with bark.</p>
<p>Yet this same air lashes their inner parts,</p>
<p>When creatures draw a breath or blow it out.</p>
<p>Wherefore, since body thus is flogged alike</p>
<p>Upon the inside and the out, and blows</p>
<p>Come in upon us through the little pores</p>
<p>Even inward to our body's primal parts</p>
<p>And primal elements, there comes to pass</p>
<p>By slow degrees, along our members then,</p>
<p>A kind of overthrow; for then confounded</p>
<p>Are those arrangements of the primal germs</p>
<p>Of body and of mind. It comes to pass</p>
<p>That next a part of soul's expelled abroad,</p>
<p>A part retreateth in recesses hid,</p>
<p>A part, too, scattered all about the frame,</p>
<p>Cannot become united nor engage</p>
<p>In interchange of motion. Nature now</p>
<p>So hedges off approaches and the paths;</p>
<p>And thus the sense, its motions all deranged,</p>
<p>Retires down deep within; and since there's naught,</p>
<p>As 'twere, to prop the frame, the body weakens,</p>
<p>And all the members languish, and the arms</p>
<p>And eyelids fall, and, as ye lie abed,</p>
<p>Even there the houghs will sag and loose their powers.</p>
<p>Again, sleep follows after food, because</p>
<p>The food produces same result as air,</p>
<p>Whilst being scattered round through all the veins;</p>
<p>And much the heaviest is that slumber which,</p>
<p>Full or fatigued, thou takest; since 'tis then</p>
<p>That the most bodies disarrange themselves,</p>
<p>Bruised by labours hard. And in same wise,</p>
<p>This three-fold change: a forcing of the soul</p>
<p>Down deeper, more a casting-forth of it,</p>
<p>A moving more divided in its parts</p>
<p>And scattered more.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="962"/>
<p rend="indent">                      And to whate'er pursuit</p>
<p>A man most clings absorbed, or what the affairs</p>
<p>On which we theretofore have tarried much,</p>
<p>And mind hath strained upon the more, we seem</p>
<p>In sleep not rarely to go at the same.</p>
<p>The lawyers seem to plead and cite decrees,</p>
<p>Commanders they to fight and go at frays,</p>
<p>Sailors to live in combat with the winds,</p>
<p>And we ourselves indeed to make this book,</p>
<p>And still to seek the nature of the world</p>
<p>And set it down, when once discovered, here</p>
<p>In these my country's leaves. Thus all pursuits,</p>
<p>All arts in general seem in sleeps to mock</p>
<p>And master the minds of men. And whosoever</p>
<p>Day after day for long to games have given</p>
<p>Attention undivided, still they keep</p>
<p>(As oft we note), even when they've ceased to grasp</p>
<p>Those games with their own senses, open paths</p>
<p>Within the mind wherethrough the idol-films</p>
<p>Of just those games can come. And thus it is</p>
<p>For many a day thereafter those appear</p>
<p>Floating before the eyes, that even awake</p>
<p>They think they view the dancers moving round</p>
<p>Their supple limbs, and catch with both the ears</p>
<p>The liquid song of harp and speaking chords,</p>
<p>And view the same assembly on the seats,</p>
<p>And manifold bright glories of the stage-</p>
<p>So great the influence of pursuit and zest,</p>
<p>And of the affairs wherein 'thas been the wont</p>
<p>Of men to be engaged-nor only men,</p>
<p>But soothly all the animals. Behold,</p>
<p>Thou'lt see the sturdy horses, though outstretched,</p>
<p>Yet sweating in their sleep, and panting ever,</p>
<p>And straining utmost strength, as if for prize,</p>
<p>As if, with barriers opened now...</p>
<p>And hounds of huntsmen oft in soft repose</p>
<p>Yet toss asudden all their legs about,</p>
<p>And growl and bark, and with their nostrils sniff</p>
<p>The winds again, again, as though indeed</p>
<p>They'd caught the scented foot-prints of wild beasts,</p>
<p>And, even when wakened, often they pursue</p>
<p>The phantom images of stags, as though</p>
<p>They did perceive them fleeing on before,</p>
<p>Until the illusion's shaken off and dogs</p>
<p>Come to themselves again. And fawning breed</p>
<p>Of house-bred whelps do feel the sudden urge</p>
<p>To shake their bodies and start from off the ground,</p>
<p>As if beholding stranger-visages.</p>
<p>And ever the fiercer be the stock, the more</p>
<p>In sleep the same is ever bound to rage.</p>
<p>But flee the divers tribes of birds and vex</p>
<p>With sudden wings by night the groves of gods,</p>
<p>When in their gentle slumbers they have dreamed</p>
<p>Of hawks in chase, aswooping on for fight.</p>
<p>Again, the minds of mortals which perform</p>
<p>With mighty motions mighty enterprises,</p>
<p>Often in sleep will do and dare the same</p>
<p>In manner like. Kings take the towns by storm,</p>
<p>Succumb to capture, battle on the field,</p>
<p>Raise a wild cry as if their throats were cut</p>
<p>Even then and there. And many wrestle on</p>
<p>And groan with pains, and fill all regions round</p>
<p>With mighty cries and wild, as if then gnawed</p>
<p>By fangs of panther or of lion fierce.</p>
<p>Many amid their slumbers talk about</p>
<p>Their mighty enterprises, and have often</p>
<p>Enough become the proof of their own crimes.</p>
<p>Many meet death; many, as if headlong</p>
<p>From lofty mountains tumbling down to earth</p>
<p>With all their frame, are frenzied in their fright;</p>
<p>And after sleep, as if still mad in mind,</p>
<p>They scarce come to, confounded as they are</p>
<p>By ferment of their frame. The thirsty man,</p>
<p>Likewise, he sits beside delightful spring</p>
<p>Or river and gulpeth down with gaping throat</p>
<p>Nigh the whole stream. And oft the innocent young,</p>
<p>By sleep o'ermastered, think they lift their dress</p>
<p>By pail or public jordan and then void</p>
<p>The water filtered down their frame entire</p>
<p>And drench the Babylonian coverlets,</p>
<p>Magnificently bright. Again, those males</p>
<p>Into the surging channels of whose years</p>
<p>Now first has passed the seed (engendered</p>
<p>Within their members by the ripened days)</p>
<p>Are in their sleep confronted from without</p>
<p>By idol-images of some fair form-</p>
<p>Tidings of glorious face and lovely bloom,</p>
<p>Which stir and goad the regions turgid now</p>
<p>With seed abundant; so that, as it were</p>
<p>With all the matter acted duly out,</p>
<p>They pour the billows of a potent stream</p>
<p>And stain their garment.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1037"/>
<p rend="indent">                         And as said before,</p>
<p>That seed is roused in us when once ripe age</p>
<p>Has made our body strong...</p>
<p>As divers causes give to divers things</p>
<p>Impulse and irritation, so one force</p>
<p>In human kind rouses the human seed</p>
<p>To spurt from man. As soon as ever it issues,</p>
<p>Forced from its first abodes, it passes down</p>
<p>In the whole body through the limbs and frame,</p>
<p>Meeting in certain regions of our thews,</p>
<p>And stirs amain the genitals of man.</p>
<p>The goaded regions swell with seed, and then</p>
<p>Comes the delight to dart the same at what</p>
<p>The mad desire so yearns, and body seeks</p>
<p>That object, whence the mind by love is pierced.</p>
<p>For well-nigh each man falleth toward his wound,</p>
<p>And our blood spurts even toward the spot from whence</p>
<p>The stroke wherewith we are strook, and if indeed</p>
<p>The foe be close, the red jet reaches him.</p>
<p>Thus, one who gets a stroke from <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>' shafts-</p>
<p>Whether a boy with limbs effeminate</p>
<p>Assault him, or a woman darting love</p>
<p>From all her body- that one strains to get</p>
<p>Even to the thing whereby he's hit, and longs</p>
<p>To join with it and cast into its frame</p>
<p>The fluid drawn even from within its own.</p>
<p>For the mute craving doth presage delight.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="1058"/>

<p rend="indent">  This craving 'tis that's <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> unto us:</p>
<p>From this, engender all the lures of love,</p>
<p>From this, O first hath into human hearts</p>
<p>Trickled that drop of joyance which ere long</p>
<p>Is by chill care succeeded. Since, indeed,</p>
<p>Though she thou lovest now be far away,</p>
<p>Yet idol-images of her are near</p>
<p>And the sweet name is floating in thy ear.</p>
<p>But it behooves to flee those images;</p>
<p>And scare afar whatever feeds thy love;</p>
<p>And turn elsewhere thy mind; and vent the sperm,</p>
<p>Within thee gathered, into sundry bodies,</p>
<p>Nor, with thy thoughts still busied with one love,</p>
<p>Keep it for one delight, and so store up</p>
<p>Care for thyself and pain inevitable.</p>
<p>For, lo, the ulcer just by nourishing</p>
<p>Grows to more life with deep inveteracy,</p>
<p>And day by day the fury swells aflame,</p>
<p>And the woe waxes heavier day by day-</p>
<p>Unless thou dost destroy even by new blows</p>
<p>The former wounds of love, and curest them</p>
<p>While yet they're fresh, by wandering freely round</p>
<p>After the freely-wandering <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>, or</p>
<p>Canst lead elsewhere the tumults of thy mind.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Nor doth that man who keeps away from love</p>
<p>Yet lack the fruits of <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>; rather takes</p>
<p>Those pleasures which are free of penalties.</p>
<p>For the delights of Venus, verily,</p>
<p>Are more unmixed for mortals sane-of-soul</p>
<p>Than for those sick-at-heart with love-pining.</p>
<p>Yea, in the very moment of possessing,</p>
<p>Surges the heat of lovers to and fro,</p>
<p>Restive, uncertain; and they cannot fix</p>
<p>On what to first enjoy with eyes and hands.</p>
<p>The parts they sought for, those they squeeze so tight,</p>
<p>And pain the creature's body, close their teeth</p>
<p>Often against her lips, and smite with kiss</p>
<p>Mouth into mouth,- because this same delight</p>
<p>Is not unmixed; and underneath are stings</p>
<p>Which goad a man to hurt the very thing,</p>
<p>Whate'er it be, from whence arise for him</p>
<p>Those germs of madness. But with gentle touch</p>
<p>Venus subdues the pangs in midst of love,</p>
<p>And the admixture of a fondling joy</p>
<p>Doth curb the bites of passion. For they hope</p>
<p>That by the very body whence they caught</p>
<p>The heats of love their flames can be put out.</p>
<p>But nature protests 'tis all quite otherwise;</p>
<p>For this same love it is the one sole thing</p>
<p>Of which, the more we have, the fiercer burns</p>
<p>The breast with fell desire. For food and drink</p>
<p>Are taken within our members; and, since they</p>
<p>Can stop up certain parts, thus, easily</p>
<p>Desire of water is glutted and of bread.</p>
<p>But, lo, from human face and lovely bloom</p>
<p>Naught penetrates our frame to be enjoyed</p>
<p>Save flimsy idol-images and vain-</p>
<p>A sorry hope which oft the winds disperse.</p>
<p>As when the thirsty man in slumber seeks</p>
<p>To drink, and water ne'er is granted him</p>
<p>Wherewith to quench the heat within his members,</p>
<p>But after idols of the liquids strives</p>
<p>And toils in vain, and thirsts even whilst he gulps</p>
<p>In middle of the torrent, thus in love</p>
<p>Venus deludes with idol-images</p>
<p>The lovers. Nor they cannot sate their lust</p>
<p>By merely gazing on the bodies, nor</p>
<p>They cannot with their palms and fingers rub</p>
<p>Aught from each tender limb, the while they stray</p>
<p>Uncertain over all the body. Then,</p>
<p>At last, with members intertwined, when they</p>
<p>Enjoy the flower of their age, when now</p>
<p>Their bodies have sweet presage of keen joys,</p>
<p>And Venus is about to sow the fields</p>
<p>Of woman, greedily their frames they lock,</p>
<p>And mingle the slaver of their mouths, and breathe</p>
<p>Into each other, pressing teeth on mouths-</p>
<p>Yet to no purpose, since they're powerless</p>
<p>To rub off aught, or penetrate and pass</p>
<p>With body entire into body- for oft</p>
<p>They seem to strive and struggle thus to do;</p>
<p>So eagerly they cling in Venus' bonds,</p>
<p>Whilst melt away their members, overcome</p>
<p>By violence of delight. But when at last</p>
<p>Lust, gathered in the thews, hath spent itself,</p>
<p>There come a brief pause in the raging heat-</p>
<p>But then a madness just the same returns</p>
<p>And that old fury visits them again,</p>
<p>When once again they seek and crave to reach</p>
<p>They know not what, all powerless to find</p>
<p>The artifice to subjugate the bane.</p>
<p>In such uncertain state they waste away</p>
<p>With unseen wound.</p>

<p>And unguents, crowns and garlands. All in vain,</p>
<p>Since from amid the well-spring of delights</p>
<p>Bubbles some drop of bitter to torment</p>
<p>Among the very flowers- when haply mind</p>
<p>Gnaws into self, now stricken with remorse</p>
<p>For slothful years and ruin in baudels,</p>
<p>Or else because she's left him all in doubt</p>
<p>By launching some sly word, which still like fire</p>
<p>Lives wildly, cleaving to his eager heart;</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="1141"/>
<p rend="indent">  These ills are found in prospering love and true;</p>
<p>But in crossed love and helpless there be such</p>
<p>As through shut eyelids thou canst still take in-</p>
<p>Uncounted ills; so that 'tis better far</p>
<p>To watch beforehand, in the way I've shown,</p>
<p>And guard against enticements. For to shun</p>
<p>A fall into the hunting-snares of love</p>
<p>Is not so hard, as to get out again,</p>
<p>When tangled in the very nets, and burst</p>
<p>The stoutly-knotted cords of Aphrodite.</p>
<p>Yet even when there enmeshed with tangled feet,</p>
<p>Still canst thou scape the danger-lest indeed</p>
<p>Thou standest in the way of thine own good,</p>
<p>And overlookest first all blemishes</p>
<p>Of mind and body of thy much preferred,</p>
<p>Desirable dame. For so men do,</p>
<p>Eyeless with passion, and assign to them</p>
<p>Graces not theirs in fact. And thus we see</p>
<p>Creatures in many a wise crooked and ugly</p>
<p>The prosperous sweethearts in a high esteem;</p>
<p>And lovers gird each other and advise</p>
<p>To placate Venus, since their friends are smit</p>
<p>With a base passion- miserable dupes</p>
<p>Who seldom mark their own worst bane of all.</p>

<p>The spiteful spit-fire, is "a sparkling wit";</p>
<p>And she who scarcely lives for scrawniness</p>
<p>Becomes "a slender darling"; "delicate"</p>
<p>Is she who's nearly dead of coughing-fit;</p>
<p>The pursy female with protuberant breasts</p>

<p>"A Satyress, a feminine Silenus";</p>
<p>The blubber-lipped is "all one luscious kiss"-</p>

<p>But let her face possess what charm ye will,</p>
<p>Let <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>' glory rise from all her limbs,-</p>

<p>All, as the ugly creature, and she scents,</p>
<p>Yes she, her wretched self with vile perfumes;</p>
<p>Whom even her handmaids flee and giggle at</p>
<p>Behind her back. But he, the lover, in tears</p>
<p>Because shut out, covers her threshold o'er</p>
<p>Often with flowers and garlands, and anoints</p>
<p>Her haughty door-posts with the marjoram,</p>
<p>And prints, poor fellow, kisses on the doors-</p>
<p>Admitted at last, if haply but one whiff</p>
<p>Got to him on approaching, he would seek</p>
<p>Decent excuses to go out forthwith;</p>
<p>And his lament, long pondered, then would fall</p>
<p>Down at his heels; and there he'd damn himself</p>
<p>For his fatuity, observing how</p>
<p>He had assigned to that same lady more-</p>
<p>Than it is proper to concede to mortals.</p>
<p>And these our Venuses are 'ware of this.</p>

<p>Nor sighs the woman always with feigned love,</p>

<p>Even from desire, and, seeking mutual joys,</p>
<p>Incites him there to run love's race-course through.</p>
<p>Nor otherwise can cattle, birds, wild beasts,</p>

<p>Mastereth or is mastered. Happens too</p>
<p>That sometimes offspring can to being come</p>
<p>In likeness of their grandsires, and bring back</p>
<p>Often the shapes of grandsires' sires, because</p>
<p>Their parents in their bodies oft retain</p>
<p>Concealed many primal germs, commixed</p>
<p>In many modes, which, starting with the stock,</p>

<p>Ancestral features, voices too, and hair.</p>
<p>A female generation rises forth</p>

<p>Or bodies or limbs of ours: for every birth</p>
<p>Is from a twofold seed; and what's created</p>
<p>Hath, of that parent which it is more like,</p>
<p>More than its equal share; as thou canst mark,-</p>
<p>Whether the breed be male or female stock.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Nor do the powers divine grudge any man</p>
<p>The fruits of his seed-sowing, so that never</p>
<p>He be called "father" by sweet children his,</p>
<p>And end his days in sterile love forever.</p>
<p>What many men suppose; and gloomily</p>
<p>They sprinkle the altars with abundant blood,</p>
<p>And make the high platforms odorous with burnt gifts,</p>
<p>To render big by plenteous seed their wives-</p>
<p>And plague in vain godheads and sacred lots.</p>
<p>For sterile are these men by seed too thick,</p>
<p>Or else by far too watery and thin.</p>
<p>Because the thin is powerless to cleave</p>
<p>Fast to the proper places, straightaway</p>
<p>It trickles from them, and, returned again,</p>
<p>Retires abortively. And then since seed</p>
<p>More gross and solid than will suit is spent</p>
<p>By some men, either it flies not forth amain</p>
<p>With spurt prolonged enough, or else it fails</p>
<p>To enter suitably the proper places,</p>
<p>Or, having entered, the seed is weakly mixed</p>
<p>With seed of the woman: harmonies of <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName></p>
<p>Are seen to matter vastly here; and some</p>
<p>Impregnate some more readily, and from some</p>
<p>Some women conceive more readily and become</p>
<p>Pregnant. And many women, sterile before</p>
<p>In several marriage-beds, have yet thereafter</p>
<p>Obtained the mates from whom they could conceive</p>
<p>The baby-boys, and with sweet progeny</p>
<p>Grow rich. And even for husbands (whose own wives,</p>
<p>Although of fertile wombs, have borne for them</p>
<p>No babies in the house) are also found</p>
<p>Concordant natures so that they at last</p>
<p>Can bulwark their old age with goodly sons.</p>
<p>A matter of great moment 'tis in truth,</p>
<p>That seeds may mingle readily with seeds</p>
<p>Suited for procreation, and that thick</p>
<p>Should mix with fluid seeds, with thick the fluid.</p>
<p>And in this business 'tis of some import</p>
<p>Upon what diet life is nourished:</p>
<p>For some foods thicken seeds within our members,</p>
<p>And others thin them out and waste away.</p>
<p>And in what modes the fond delight itself</p>
<p>Is carried on- this too importeth vastly.</p>
<p>For commonly 'tis thought that wives conceive</p>
<p>More readily in manner of wild-beasts,</p>
<p>After the custom of the four-foot breeds,</p>
<p>Because so postured, with the breasts beneath</p>
<p>And buttocks then upreared, the seeds can take</p>
<p>Their proper places. Nor is need the least</p>
<p>For wives to use the motions of blandishment;</p>
<p>For thus the woman hinders and resists</p>
<p>Her own conception, if too joyously</p>
<p>Herself she treats the <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> of the man</p>
<p>With haunches heaving, and with all her bosom</p>
<p>Now yielding like the billows of the sea-</p>
<p>Aye, from the ploughshare's even course and track</p>
<p>She throws the furrow, and from proper places</p>
<p>Deflects the spurt of seed. And courtesans</p>
<p>Are thuswise wont to move for their own ends,</p>
<p>To keep from pregnancy and lying in,</p>
<p>And all the while to render <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> more</p>
<p>A pleasure for the men- the which meseems</p>

<p>Worthy the majesty of these great finds?</p>
<p>Or who in words so strong that he can frame</p>
<p>The fit laudations for deserts of him</p>
<p>Who left us heritors of such vast prizes,</p>
<p>By his own breast discovered and sought out?-</p>
<p>There shall be none, methinks, of mortal stock.</p>
<p>For if must needs be named for him the name</p>
<p>Demanded by the now known majesty</p>
<p>Of these high matters, then a god was he,-</p>
<p>Hear me, illustrious Memmius- a god;</p>
<p>Who first and chief found out that plan of life</p>
<p>Which now is called philosophy, and who</p>
<p>By cunning craft, out of such mighty waves,</p>
<p>Out of such mighty darkness, moored life</p>
<p>In havens so serene, in light so clear.</p>
<p>Compare those old discoveries divine</p>
<p>Of others: lo, according to the tale,</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,2068435">Ceres</placeName> established for mortality</p>
<p>The grain, and <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> juice of vine-born grape,</p>
<p>Though life might yet without these things abide,</p>
<p>Even as report saith now some peoples live.</p>
<p>But man's well-being was impossible</p>
<p>Without a breast all free. Wherefore the more</p>
<p>That man doth justly seem to us a god,</p>
<p>From whom sweet solaces of life, afar</p>
<p>Distributed o'er populous domains,</p>
<p>Now soothe the minds of men. But if thou thinkest</p>
<p>Labours of <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> excel the same,</p>
<p>Much farther from true reasoning thou farest.</p>
<p>For what could hurt us now that mighty maw</p>
<p>Of Nemeaean Lion, or what the Boar</p>
<p>Who bristled in <placeName key="tgn,2094818">Arcadia</placeName>? Or, again,</p>
<p>O what could Cretan Bull, or Hydra, pest</p>

<p>Or what the triple-breasted power of her</p>
<p>The three-fold Geryon...</p>
<p>The sojourners in the Stymphalian fens</p>
<p>So dreadfully offend us, or the Steeds</p>
<p>Of Thracian Diomedes breathing fire</p>
<p>From out their nostrils off along the zones</p>
<p>Bistonian and Ismarian? And the Snake,</p>
<p>The dread fierce gazer, guardian of the golden</p>
<p>And gleaming apples of the Hesperides,</p>
<p>Coiled round the tree-trunk with tremendous bulk,</p>
<p>O what, again, could he inflict on us</p>
<p>Along the <placeName key="tgn,1002157">Atlantic</placeName> shore and wastes of sea?-</p>
<p>Where neither one of us approacheth nigh</p>
<p>Nor no barbarian ventures. And the rest</p>
<p>Of all those monsters slain, even if alive,</p>
<p>Unconquered still, what injury could they do?</p>
<p>None, as I guess. For so the glutted earth</p>
<p>Swarms even now with savage beasts, even now</p>
<p>Is filled with anxious terrors through the woods</p>
<p>And mighty mountains and the forest deeps-</p>
<p>Quarters 'tis ours in general to avoid.</p>
<p>But lest the breast be purged, what conflicts then,</p>
<p>What perils, must bosom, in our own despite!</p>
<p>O then how great and keen the cares of lust</p>
<p>That split the man distraught! How great the fears!</p>
<p>And lo, the pride, grim greed, and wantonness-</p>
<p>How great the slaughters in their train! and lo,</p>
<p>Debaucheries and every breed of sloth!</p>
<p>Therefore that man who subjugated these,</p>

<p>And in what modes hath bosomed in their breasts</p>
<p>That awe of gods, which halloweth in all lands</p>

<p>The steersman nature guides the sun's courses,</p>

<p>Timing their motions for increase of crops</p>
<p>And living creatures, or lest we should think</p>
<p>They roll along by any plan of gods.</p>
<p>For even those men who have learned full well</p>
<p>That godheads lead a long life free of care,</p>
<p>If yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan</p>
<p>Things can go on (and chiefly yon high things</p>

<p>Of old religion and adopt again</p>
<p>Harsh masters, deemed almighty,- wretched men,</p>
<p>Unwitting what can be and what cannot,</p>

<p>Their bodies three, three aspects so unlike,</p>
<p>Three frames so vast, a single day shall give</p>

<p>Oracles holier and soundlier based</p>
<p>Than ever the Pythian pronounced for men</p>

<p>I will unfold for thee with learned words</p>

<p>Still bridled by religion, thou suppose</p>
<p>Lands, sun, and sky, sea, constellations, moon,</p>
<p>Must dure forever, as of frame divine-</p>
<p>And so conclude that it is just that those,</p>
<p>(After the manner of the Giants), should all</p>
<p>Pay the huge penalties for monstrous crime,</p>
<p>Who by their reasonings do overshake</p>
<p>The ramparts of the universe and wish</p>
<p>There to put out the splendid sun of heaven,</p>
<p>Branding with mortal talk immortal things-</p>
<p>Though these same things are even so far removed</p>
<p>From any touch of deity and seem</p>
<p>So far unworthy of numbering with the gods,</p>
<p>That well they may be thought to furnish rather</p>
<p>A goodly instance of the sort of things</p>
<p>That lack the living motion, living sense.</p>
<p>For sure 'tis quite beside the mark to think</p>
<p>That judgment and the nature of the mind</p>
<p>In any kind of body can exist-</p>
<p>Just as in ether can't exist a tree,</p>
<p>Nor clouds in the salt sea, nor in the fields</p>
<p>Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,</p>
<p>Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged</p>
<p>Where everything may grow and have its place.</p>
<p>Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone</p>
<p>Without the body, nor have its being far</p>
<p>From thews and blood. Yet if 'twere possible?-</p>
<p>Much rather might this very power of mind</p>
<p>Be in the head, the shoulders, or the heels,</p>
<p>And, born in any part soever, yet</p>
<p>In the same man, in the same vessel abide</p>
<p>But since within this body even of ours</p>
<p>Stands fixed and appears arranged sure</p>
<p>Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,</p>
<p>Deny we must the more that they can dure</p>
<p>Outside the body and the breathing form</p>
<p>In rotting clods of earth, in the sun's fire,</p>
<p>In water, or in ether's skiey coasts.</p>
<p>Therefore these things no whit are furnished</p>
<p>With sense divine, since never can they be</p>
<p>With life-force quickened.</p>

<p>Believe the sacred seats of gods are here</p>
<p>In any regions of this mundane world;</p>
<p>Indeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle,</p>
<p>So far removed from these our senses, scarce</p>
<p>Is seen even by intelligence of mind.</p>
<p>And since they've ever eluded touch and thrust</p>
<p>Of human hands, they cannot reach to grasp</p>
<p>Aught tangible to us. For what may not</p>

<p>Wherefore, besides, also their seats must be</p>
<p>Unlike these seats of ours,- even subtle too,</p>
<p>As meet for subtle essence- as I'll prove</p>
<p>Hereafter unto thee with large discourse.</p>
<p>Further, to say that for the sake of men</p>
<p>They willed to prepare this world's magnificence,</p>

<p>What hath been stablished by the Forethought old</p>

<p>And that 'tis sacrilege to assault by words</p>
<p>And overtopple all from base to beam,-</p>
<p>Memmius, such notions to concoct and pile,</p>
<p>Is verily- to dote. Our gratefulness,</p>
<p>O what emoluments could it confer</p>
<p>Upon Immortals and upon the Blessed</p>
<p>That they should take a step to manage aught</p>
<p>For sake of us? Or what new factor could,</p>
<p>After so long a time, inveigle them-</p>
<p>The hitherto reposeful- to desire</p>
<p>To change their former life? For rather he</p>
<p>Whom old things chafe seems likely to rejoice</p>
<p>At new; but one that in fore-passed time</p>
<p>Hath chanced upon no ill, through goodly years,</p>
<p>O what could ever enkindle in such an one</p>
<p>Passion for strange experiment? Or what</p>
<p>The evil for us, if we had ne'er been born?-</p>
<p>As though, forsooth, in darkling realms and woe</p>
<p>Our life were lying till should dawn at last</p>
<p>The day-spring of creation! Whosoever</p>
<p>Hath been begotten wills perforce to stay</p>
<p>In life, so long as fond delight detains;</p>
<p>But whoso ne'er hath tasted love of life,</p>
<p>And ne'er was in the count of living things,</p>
<p>What hurts it him that he was never born?</p>
<p>Whence, further, first was planted in the gods</p>
<p>The archetype for gendering the world</p>
<p>And the fore-notion of what man is like,</p>
<p>So that they knew and pre-conceived with mind</p>
<p>Just what they wished to make? Or how were known</p>
<p>Ever the energies of primal germs,</p>
<p>And what those germs, by interchange of place,</p>
<p>Could thus produce, if nature's self had not</p>
<p>Given example for creating all?</p>
<p>For in such wise primordials of things,</p>
<p>Many in many modes, astir by blows</p>
<p>From immemorial aeons, in motion too</p>
<p>By their own weights, have evermore been wont</p>
<p>To be so borne along and in all modes</p>
<p>To meet together and to try all sorts</p>
<p>Which, by combining one with other, they</p>
<p>Are powerful to create, that thus it is</p>
<p>No marvel now, if they have also fallen</p>
<p>Into arrangements such, and if they've passed</p>
<p>Into vibrations such, as those whereby</p>
<p>This sum of things is carried on to-day</p>
<p>By fixed renewal.</p>

<p>That in no wise the nature of all things</p>
<p>For us was fashioned by a power divine-</p>
<p>So great the faults it stands encumbered with.</p>
<p>First, mark all regions which are overarched</p>
<p>By the prodigious reaches of the sky:</p>
<p>One yawning part thereof the mountain-chains</p>
<p>And forests of the beasts do have and hold;</p>
<p>And cliffs, and desert fens, and wastes of sea</p>
<p>(Which sunder afar the beaches of the lands)</p>
<p>Possess it merely; and, again, thereof</p>
<p>Well-nigh two-thirds intolerable heat</p>
<p>And a perpetual fall of frost doth rob</p>
<p>From mortal kind. And what is left to till,</p>
<p>Even that the force of nature would o'errun</p>
<p>With brambles, did not human force oppose,-</p>
<p>Long wont for livelihood to groan and sweat</p>
<p>Over the two-pronged mattock and to cleave</p>
<p>The soil in twain by pressing on the plough.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>Unless, by the ploughshare turning the fruitful clods</p>
<p>And kneading the mould, we quicken into birth,</p>
<p>[The crops] spontaneously could not come up</p>
<p>Into the free bright air. Even then sometimes,</p>
<p>When things acquired by the sternest toil</p>
<p>Are now in leaf, are now in blossom all,</p>
<p>Either the skiey sun with baneful heats</p>
<p>Parches, or sudden rains or chilling rime</p>
<p>Destroys, or flaws of winds with furious whirl</p>
<p>Torment and twist. Beside these matters, why</p>
<p>Doth nature feed and foster on land and sea</p>
<p>The dreadful breed of savage beasts, the foes</p>
<p>Of the human clan? Why do the seasons bring</p>
<p>Distempers with them? Wherefore stalks at large</p>
<p>Death, so untimely? Then, again, the babe,</p>
<p>Like to the castaway of the raging surf,</p>
<p>Lies naked on the ground, speechless, in want</p>
<p>Of every help for life, when nature first</p>
<p>Hath poured him forth upon the shores of light</p>
<p>With birth-pangs from within the mother's womb,</p>
<p>And with a plaintive wail he fills the place,-</p>
<p>As well befitting one for whom remains</p>
<p>In life a journey through so many ills.</p>
<p>But all the flocks and herds and all wild beasts</p>
<p>Come forth and grow, nor need the little rattles,</p>
<p>Nor must be treated to the humouring nurse's</p>
<p>Dear, broken chatter; nor seek they divers clothes</p>
<p>To suit the changing skies; nor need, in fine,</p>
<p>Nor arms, nor lofty ramparts, wherewithal</p>

<p>The Sum is new, and of a recent date</p>
<p>The nature of our universe, and had</p>

<p>For these consist of seeds more smooth and round</p>
<p>And of much smaller elements than earth.</p>
<p>And thus it was that ether, fraught with fire,</p>
<p>First broke away from out the earthen parts,</p>
<p>Athrough the innumerable pores of earth,</p>
<p>And raised itself aloft, and with itself</p>

<p>With now concreted body weave a cover</p>
<p>Beneath the heavens. And thuswise ether too,</p>
<p>Light and diffusive, with concreted body</p>
<p>On all sides spread, on all sides bent itself</p>
<p>Into a dome, and, far and wide diffused</p>
<p>On unto every region on all sides,</p>
<p>Thus hedged all else within its greedy clasp.</p>
<p>Hard upon ether came the origins</p>
<p>Of sun and moon, whose globes revolve in air</p>
<p>Midway between the earth and mightiest ether,-</p>
<p>For neither took them, since they weighed too little</p>
<p>To sink and settle, but too much to glide</p>
<p>Along the upmost shores; and yet they are</p>
<p>In such a wise midway between the twain</p>
<p>As ever to whirl their living bodies round,</p>
<p>And ever to dure as parts of the wide Whole;</p>
<p>In the same fashion as certain members may</p>
<p>In us remain at rest, whilst others move.</p>
<p>When, then, these substances had been withdrawn,</p>
<p>Amain the earth, where now extend the vast</p>
<p>Cerulean zones of all the level seas,</p>

<p>The more the tides of ether and rays of sun</p>
<p>On every side constrained into one mass</p>
<p>The earth by lashing it again, again,</p>
<p>Upon its outer edges (so that then,</p>

<p>Augmented ocean and the fields of foam</p>

<p>By condensation there afar from earth,</p>
<p>The high refulgent circuits of the heavens.</p>
<p>The plains began to sink, and windy slopes</p>

<p>Presses a certain air, and from without</p>
<p>Confines them and encloseth at each end;</p>
<p>And that, moreover, another air above</p>
<p>Streams on athwart the top of the sphere and tends</p>
<p>In same direction as are rolled along</p>

<p>Or that another still streams on below</p>

<p>It may be also that the heavens do all</p>
<p>Remain at rest, whilst yet are borne along</p>
<p>The lucid constellations; either because</p>
<p>Swift tides of ether are by sky enclosed,</p>
<p>And whirl around, seeking a passage out,</p>
<p>And everywhere make roll the starry fires</p>
<p>Through the Summanian regions of the sky;</p>
<p>Or else because some air, streaming along</p>
<p>From an eternal quarter off beyond,</p>
<p>Whileth the driven fires, or, then, because</p>
<p>The fires themselves have power to creep along,</p>
<p>Going wherever their food invites and calls,</p>
<p>And feeding their flaming bodies everywhere</p>

<p>Conjoined to it from its earliest age</p>
<p>In linked unison with the vasty world's</p>
<p>Realms of the air in which it roots and lives.</p>
<p>On this account, the earth is not a load,</p>
<p>Nor presses down on winds of air beneath;</p>
<p>Even as unto a man his members be</p>
<p>Without all weight- the head is not a load</p>

<p>Weights laid upon us, these harass and chafe,</p>

<p>Now seest thou not how powerful may be</p>

<p>In just so far as is her course removed</p>
<p>From upper heaven and nigh unto the lands,</p>
<p>In just so far she fails to keep the pace</p>
<p>With starry signs above; for just so far</p>
<p>As feebler is the whirl that bears her on,</p>
<p>(Being, indeed, still lower than the sun),</p>
<p>In just so far do all the starry signs,</p>
<p>Circling around, o'ertake her and o'erpass.</p>
<p>Therefore it happens that the moon appears</p>
<p>More swiftly to return to any sign</p>
<p>Along the Zodiac, than doth the sun,</p>
<p>Because those signs do visit her again</p>
<p>More swiftly than they visit the great sun.</p>
<p>It can be also that two streams of air</p>
<p>Alternately at fixed periods</p>
<p>Blow out from transverse regions of the world,</p>
<p>Of which the one may thrust the sun away</p>
<p>From summer-signs to mid-most winter goals</p>
<p>And rigors of the cold, and the other then</p>
<p>May cast him back from icy shades of chill</p>
<p>Even to the heat-fraught regions and the signs</p>
<p>That blaze along the Zodiac. So, too,</p>
<p>We must suppose the moon and all the stars,</p>
<p>Which through the mighty and sidereal years</p>
<p>Roll round in mighty orbits, may be sped</p>
<p>By streams of air from regions alternate.</p>
<p>Seest thou not also how the clouds be sped</p>
<p>By contrary winds to regions contrary,</p>
<p>The lower clouds diversely from the upper?</p>
<p>Then, why may yonder stars in ether there</p>
<p>Along their mighty orbits not be borne</p>
<p>By currents opposite the one to other?</p>

<p rend="indent">  But night o'erwhelms the lands with vasty murk</p>
<p>Either when sun, after his diurnal course,</p>
<p>Hath walked the ultimate regions of the sky</p>
<p>And wearily hath panted forth his fires,</p>
<p>Shivered by their long journeying and wasted</p>
<p>By traversing the multitudinous air,</p>
<p>Or else because the self-same force that drave</p>
<p>His orb along above the lands compels</p>
<p>Him then to turn his course beneath the lands.</p>
<p>Matuta also at a fixed hour</p>
<p>Spreadeth the roseate morning out along</p>
<p>The coasts of heaven and deploys the light,</p>
<p>Either because the self-same sun, returning</p>
<p>Under the lands, aspires to seize the sky,</p>
<p>Striving to set it blazing with his rays</p>
<p>Ere he himself appear, or else because</p>
<p>Fires then will congregate and many seeds</p>
<p>Of heat are wont, even at a fixed time,</p>
<p>To stream together- gendering evermore</p>
<p>New suns and light. Just so the story goes</p>
<p>That from the Idaean mountain-tops are seen</p>
<p>Dispersed fires upon the break of day</p>
<p>Which thence combine, as 'twere, into one ball</p>
<p>And form an orb. Nor yet in these affairs</p>
<p>Is aught for wonder that these seeds of fire</p>
<p>Can thus together stream at time so fixed</p>
<p>And shape anew the splendour of the sun.</p>
<p>For many facts we see which come to pass</p>
<p>At fixed time in all things: burgeon shrubs</p>
<p>At fixed time, and at a fixed time</p>
<p>They cast their flowers; and Eld commands the teeth,</p>
<p>At time as surely fixed, to drop away,</p>
<p>And Youth commands the growing boy to bloom</p>
<p>With the soft down and let from both his cheeks</p>
<p>The soft beard fall. And lastly, thunder-bolts,</p>
<p>Snow, rains, clouds, winds, at seasons of the year</p>
<p>Nowise unfixed, all do come to pass.</p>
<p>For where, even from their old primordial start</p>
<p>Causes have ever worked in such a way,</p>
<p>And where, even from the world's first origin,</p>
<p>Thuswise have things befallen, so even now</p>

<p>In sequence also.</p>

<p>Whilst the nights wane, and daylight minished be</p>
<p>Whilst nights do take their augmentations,</p>
<p>Either because the self-same sun, coursing</p>
<p>Under the lands and over in two arcs,</p>
<p>A longer and a briefer, doth dispart</p>
<p>The coasts of ether and divides in twain</p>
<p>His orbit all unequally, and adds,</p>
<p>As round he's borne, unto the one half there</p>
<p>As much as from the other half he's ta'en,</p>
<p>Until he then arrives that sign of heaven</p>
<p>Where the year's node renders the shades of night</p>
<p>Equal unto the periods of light.</p>
<p>For when the sun is midway on his course</p>
<p>Between the blasts of northwind and of south,</p>
<p>Heaven keeps his two goals parted equally,</p>
<p>By virtue of the fixed position old</p>
<p>Of the whole starry Zodiac, through which</p>
<p>That sun, in winding onward, takes a year,</p>
<p>Illumining the sky and all the lands</p>
<p>With oblique light- as men declare to us</p>
<p>Who by their diagrams have charted well</p>
<p>Those regions of the sky which be adorned</p>
<p>With the arranged signs of Zodiac.</p>
<p>Or else, because in certain parts the air</p>
<p>Under the lands is denser, the tremulous</p>
<p>Bright beams of fire do waver tardily,</p>
<p>Nor easily can penetrate that air</p>
<p>Nor yet emerge unto their rising-place:</p>
<p>For this it is that nights in winter time</p>
<p>Do linger long, ere comes the many-rayed</p>
<p>Round Badge of the day. Or else because, as said,</p>
<p>In alternating seasons of the year</p>
<p>Fires, now more quick, and now more slow, are wont</p>
<p>To stream together,- the fires which make the sun</p>
<p>To rise in some one spot- therefore it is</p>
<p>That those men seem to speak the truth [who hold</p>
<p>A new sun is with each new daybreak born].</p>

<p rend="indent">  The moon she possibly doth shine because</p>
<p>Strook by the rays of sun, and day by day</p>
<p>May turn unto our gaze her light, the more</p>
<p>She doth recede from orb of sun, until,</p>
<p>Facing him opposite across the world,</p>
<p>She hath with full effulgence gleamed abroad,</p>
<p>And, at her rising as she soars above,</p>
<p>Hath there observed his setting; thence likewise</p>
<p>She needs must hide, as 'twere, her light behind</p>
<p>By slow degrees, the nearer now she glides,</p>
<p>Along the circle of the Zodiac,</p>
<p>From her far place toward fires of yonder sun,-</p>
<p>As those men hold who feign the moon to be</p>
<p>Just like a ball and to pursue a course</p>
<p>Betwixt the sun and earth. There is, again,</p>
<p>Some reason to suppose that moon may roll</p>
<p>With light her very own, and thus display</p>
<p>The varied shapes of her resplendence there.</p>
<p>For near her is, percase, another body,</p>
<p>Invisible, because devoid of light,</p>
<p>Borne on and gliding all along with her,</p>
<p>Which in three modes may block and blot her disk.</p>
<p>Again, she may revolve upon herself,</p>
<p>Like to a ball's sphere- if perchance that be-</p>
<p>One half of her dyed o'er with glowing light,</p>
<p>And by the revolution of that sphere</p>
<p>She may beget for us her varying shapes,</p>
<p>Until she turns that fiery part of her</p>
<p>Full to the sight and open eyes of men;</p>
<p>Thence by slow stages round and back she whirls,</p>
<p>Withdrawing thus the luminiferous part</p>
<p>Of her sphered mass and ball, as, verily,</p>
<p>The Babylonian doctrine of Chaldees,</p>
<p>Refuting the art of Greek astrologers,</p>
<p>Labours, in opposition, to prove sure-</p>
<p>As if, forsooth, the thing for which each fights,</p>
<p>Might not alike be true,- or aught there were</p>
<p>Wherefore thou mightest risk embracing one</p>
<p>More than the other notion. Then, again,</p>
<p>Why a new moon might not forevermore</p>
<p>Created be with fixed successions there</p>
<p>Of shapes and with configurations fixed,</p>
<p>And why each day that bright created moon</p>
<p>Might not miscarry and another be,</p>
<p>In its stead and place, engendered anew,</p>
<p>'Tis hard to show by reason, or by words</p>
<p>To prove absurd- since, lo, so many things</p>
<p>Can be create with fixed successions:</p>
<p>Spring-time and Venus come, and Venus' boy,</p>
<p>The winged harbinger, steps on before,</p>
<p>And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora,</p>
<p>Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all</p>
<p>With colours and with odours excellent;</p>
<p>Whereafter follows arid Heat, and he</p>
<p>Companioned is by <placeName key="tgn,2082988">Ceres</placeName>, dusty one,</p>
<p>And by the Etesian Breezes of the north;</p>
<p>Then cometh Autumn on, and with him steps</p>
<p>Lord Bacchus, and then other Seasons too</p>
<p>And other Winds do follow- the high roar</p>
<p>Of great Volturnus, and the <placeName key="tgn,2682863">Southwind</placeName> strong</p>
<p>With thunder-bolts. At last earth's Shortest-Day</p>
<p>Bears on to men the snows and brings again</p>
<p>The numbing cold. And Winter follows her,</p>
<p>His teeth with chills a-chatter. Therefore, 'tis</p>
<p>The less a marvel, if at fixed time</p>
<p>A moon is thus begotten and again</p>
<p>At fixed time destroyed, since things so many</p>
<p>Can come to being thus at fixed time.</p>
<p>Likewise, the sun's eclipses and the moon's</p>
<p>Far occultations rightly thou mayst deem</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="751"/>
<p rend="indent">  As due to several causes. For, indeed,</p>
<p>Why should the moon be able to shut out</p>
<p>Earth from the light of sun, and on the side</p>
<p>To earthward thrust her high head under sun,</p>
<p>Opposing dark orb to his glowing beams-</p>
<p>And yet, at same time, one suppose the effect</p>
<p>Could not result from some one other body</p>
<p>Which glides devoid of light forevermore?</p>
<p>Again, why could not sun, in weakened state,</p>
<p>At fixed time for-lose his fires, and then,</p>
<p>When he has passed on along the air</p>
<p>Beyond the regions, hostile to his flames,</p>
<p>That quench and kill his fires, why could not he</p>
<p>Renew his light? And why should earth in turn</p>
<p>Have power to rob the moon of light, and there,</p>
<p>Herself on high, keep the sun hid beneath,</p>
<p>Whilst the moon glideth in her monthly course</p>
<p>Athrough the rigid shadows of the cone?-</p>
<p>And yet, at same time, some one other body</p>
<p>Not have the power to under-pass the moon,</p>
<p>Or glide along above the orb of sun,</p>
<p>Breaking his rays and outspread light asunder?</p>
<p>And still, if moon herself refulgent be</p>
<p>With her own sheen, why could she not at times</p>
<p>In some one quarter of the mighty world</p>
<p>Grow weak and weary, whilst she passeth through</p>
<p>Regions unfriendly to the beams her own?</p>

<p rend="indent">  And now to what remains!- Since I've resolved</p>
<p>By what arrangements all things come to pass</p>
<p>Through the blue regions of the mighty world,-</p>
<p>How we can know what energy and cause</p>
<p>Started the various courses of the sun</p>
<p>And the moon's goings, and by what far means</p>
<p>They can succumb, the while with thwarted light,</p>
<p>And veil with shade the unsuspecting lands,</p>
<p>When, as it were, they blink, and then again</p>
<p>With open eye survey all regions wide,</p>
<p>Resplendent with white radiance- I do now</p>
<p>Return unto the world's primeval age</p>
<p>And tell what first the soft young fields of earth</p>
<p>With earliest parturition had decreed</p>
<p>To raise in air unto the shores of light</p>
<p>And to entrust unto the wayward winds.</p>
<p>In the beginning, earth gave forth, around</p>
<p>The hills and over all the length of plains,</p>
<p>The race of grasses and the shining green;</p>
<p>The flowery meadows sparkled all aglow</p>
<p>With greening colour, and thereafter, lo,</p>
<p>Unto the divers kinds of trees was given</p>
<p>An emulous impulse mightily to shoot,</p>
<p>With a free rein, aloft into the air.</p>
<p>As feathers and hairs and bristles are begot</p>
<p>The first on members of the four-foot breeds</p>
<p>And on the bodies of the strong-y-winged,</p>
<p>Thus then the new Earth first of all put forth</p>
<p>Grasses and shrubs, and afterward begat</p>
<p>The mortal generations, there upsprung-</p>
<p>Innumerable in modes innumerable-</p>
<p>After diverging fashions. For from sky</p>
<p>These breathing-creatures never can have dropped,</p>
<p>Nor the land-dwellers ever have come up</p>
<p>Out of sea-pools of salt. How true remains,</p>
<p>How merited is that adopted name</p>
<p>Of earth- "The Mother!"- since from out the earth</p>
<p>Are all begotten. And even now arise</p>
<p>From out the loams how many living things-</p>
<p>Concreted by the rains and heat of the sun.</p>
<p>Wherefore 'tis less a marvel, if they sprang</p>
<p>In Long Ago more many, and more big,</p>
<p>Matured of those days in the fresh young years</p>
<p>Of earth and ether. First of all, the race</p>
<p>Of the winged ones and parti-coloured birds,</p>
<p>Hatched out in spring-time, left their eggs behind;</p>
<p>As now-a-days in summer tree-crickets</p>
<p>Do leave their shiny husks of own accord,</p>
<p>Seeking their food and living. Then it was</p>
<p>This earth of thine first gave unto the day</p>
<p>The mortal generations; for prevailed</p>
<p>Among the fields abounding hot and wet.</p>
<p>And hence, where any fitting spot was given,</p>
<p>There 'gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots</p>
<p>Affixed to earth. And when in ripened time</p>
<p>The age of the young within (that sought the air</p>
<p>And fled earth's damps) had burst these wombs, O then</p>
<p>Would Nature thither turn the pores of earth</p>
<p>And make her spurt from open veins a juice</p>
<p>Like unto milk; even as a woman now</p>
<p>Is filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk,</p>
<p>Because all that swift stream of aliment</p>
<p>Is thither turned unto the mother-breasts.</p>
<p>There earth would furnish to the children food;</p>
<p>Warmth was their swaddling cloth, the grass their bed</p>
<p>Abounding in soft down. Earth's newness then</p>
<p>Would rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold,</p>
<p>Nor extreme heats nor winds of mighty powers-</p>
<p>For all things grow and gather strength through time</p>
<p>In like proportions; and then earth was young.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Wherefore, again, again, how merited</p>
<p>Is that adopted name of Earth- The Mother!-</p>
<p>Since she herself begat the human race,</p>
<p>And at one well-nigh fixed time brought forth</p>
<p>Each breast that ranges raving round about</p>
<p>Upon the mighty mountains and all birds</p>
<p>Aerial with many a varied shape.</p>
<p>But, lo, because her bearing years must end,</p>
<p>She ceased, like to a woman worn by eld.</p>
<p>For lapsing aeons change the nature of</p>
<p>The whole wide world, and all things needs must take</p>
<p>One status after other, nor aught persists</p>
<p>Forever like itself. All things depart;</p>

<p>In suchwise, then, the lapsing aeons change</p>

<p>Cleaving unto the body fore and aft,</p>
<p>Thuswise, that never could they do or go,</p>

<p>Since Nature banned with horror their increase,</p>
<p>And powerless were they to reach unto</p>
<p>The coveted flower of fair maturity,</p>
<p>Or to find aliment, or to intertwine</p>

<p>Rivers of gold through every landscape flowed,</p>

<p>With such gigantic length and lift of limbs</p>
<p>As to be able, based upon his feet,</p>
<p>Deep oceans to bestride or with his hands</p>
<p>To whirl the firmament around his head.</p>
<p>For though in earth were many seeds of things</p>

<p>With gush and splash abounding laved the rocks,</p>
<p>The dripping rocks, and trickled from above</p>
<p>Over the verdant moss; and here and there</p>
<p>Welled up and burst across the open flats.</p>
<p>As yet they knew not to enkindle fire</p>
<p>Against the cold, nor hairy pelts to use</p>
<p>And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts;</p>
<p>But huddled in groves, and mountain-caves, and woods,</p>
<p>And 'mongst the thickets hid their squalid backs,</p>
<p>When driven to flee the lashings of the winds</p>
<p>And the big rains. Nor could they then regard</p>
<p>The general good, nor did they know to use</p>
<p>In common any customs, any laws:</p>
<p>Whatever of booty fortune unto each</p>
<p>Had proffered, each alone would bear away,</p>
<p>By instinct trained for self to thrive and live.</p>
<p>And <placeName key="tgn,2744069">Venus</placeName> in the forests then would link</p>

<p>Either from mutual flame, or from the man's</p>
<p>Impetuous fury and insatiate lust,</p>
<p>Or from a bribe- as acorn-nuts, choice pears,</p>
<p>Or the wild berries of the arbute-tree.</p>
<p>And trusting wondrous strength of hands and legs,</p>
<p>They'd chase the forest-wanderers, the beasts;</p>
<p>And many they'd conquer, but some few they fled,</p>
<p>A-skulk into their hiding-places...</p>

<p>With the flung stones and with the ponderous heft</p>
<p>Of gnarled branch. And by the time of night</p>
<p>O'ertaken, they would throw, like bristly boars,</p>
<p>Their wildman's limbs naked upon the earth,</p>
<p>Rolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs.</p>
<p>Nor would they call with lamentations loud</p>
<p>Around the fields for daylight and the sun,</p>
<p>Quaking and wand'ring in shadows of the night;</p>
<p>But, silent and buried in a sleep, they'd wait</p>
<p>Until the sun with rosy flambeau brought</p>
<p>The glory to the sky. From childhood wont</p>
<p>Ever to see the dark and day begot</p>
<p>In times alternate, never might they be</p>
<p>Wildered by wild misgiving, lest a night</p>
<p>Eternal should possess the lands, with light</p>
<p>Of sun withdrawn forever. But their care</p>
<p>Was rather that the clans of savage beasts</p>
<p>Would often make their sleep-time horrible</p>
<p>For those poor wretches; and, from home y-driven,</p>
<p>They'd flee their rocky shelters at approach</p>
<p>Of boar, the spumy-lipped, or lion strong,</p>
<p>And in the midnight yield with terror up</p>
<p>To those fierce guests their beds of out-spread leaves.</p>

<p rend="indent">  And yet in those days not much more than now</p>
<p>Would generations of mortality</p>
<p>Leave the sweet light of fading life behind.</p>
<p>Indeed, in those days here and there a man,</p>
<p>More oftener snatched upon, and gulped by fangs,</p>
<p>Afforded the beasts a food that roared alive,</p>
<p>Echoing through groves and hills and forest-trees,</p>
<p>Even as he viewed his living flesh entombed</p>
<p>Within a living grave; whilst those whom flight</p>
<p>Had saved, with bone and body bitten, shrieked,</p>
<p>Pressing their quivering palms to loathsome sores,</p>
<p>With horrible voices for eternal death-</p>
<p>Until, forlorn of help, and witless what</p>
<p>Might medicine their wounds, the writhing pangs</p>
<p>Took them from life. But not in those far times</p>
<p>Would one lone day give over unto doom</p>
<p>A soldiery in thousands marching on</p>
<p>Beneath the battle-banners, nor would then</p>
<p>The ramping breakers of the main seas dash</p>
<p>Whole argosies and crews upon the rocks.</p>
<p>But ocean uprisen would often rave in vain,</p>
<p>Without all end or outcome, and give up</p>
<p>Its empty menacings as lightly too;</p>
<p>Nor soft seductions of a serene sea</p>
<p>Could lure by laughing billows any man</p>
<p>Out to disaster: for the science bold</p>
<p>Of ship-sailing lay dark in those far times.</p>
<p>Again, 'twas then that lack of food gave o'er</p>
<p>Men's fainting limbs to dissolution: now</p>
<p>'Tis plenty overwhelms. Unwary, they</p>
<p>Oft for themselves themselves would then outpour</p>
<p>The poison; now, with nicer art, themselves</p>
<p>They give the drafts to others.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="1028"/>
<p rend="indent">                           But nature 'twas</p>
<p>Urged men to utter various sounds of tongue</p>
<p>And need and use did mould the names of things,</p>
<p>About in same wise as the lack-speech years</p>
<p>Compel young children unto gesturings,</p>
<p>Making them point with finger here and there</p>
<p>At what's before them. For each creature feels</p>
<p>By instinct to what use to put his powers.</p>
<p>Ere yet the bull-calf's scarce begotten horns</p>
<p>Project above his brows, with them he 'gins</p>
<p>Enraged to butt and savagely to thrust.</p>
<p>But whelps of panthers and the lion's cubs</p>
<p>With claws and paws and bites are at the fray</p>
<p>Already, when their teeth and claws be scarce</p>
<p>As yet engendered. So again, we see</p>
<p>All breeds of winged creatures trust to wings</p>
<p>And from their fledgling pinions seek to get</p>
<p>A fluttering assistance. Thus, to think</p>
<p>That in those days some man apportioned round</p>
<p>To things their names, and that from him men learned</p>
<p>Their first nomenclature, is foolery.</p>
<p>For why could he mark everything by words</p>
<p>And utter the various sounds of tongue, what time</p>
<p>The rest may be supposed powerless</p>
<p>To do the same? And, if the rest had not</p>
<p>Already one with other used words,</p>
<p>Whence was implanted in the teacher, then,</p>
<p>Fore-knowledge of their use, and whence was given</p>
<p>To him alone primordial faculty</p>
<p>To know and see in mind what 'twas he willed?</p>
<p>Besides, one only man could scarce subdue</p>
<p>An overmastered multitude to choose</p>
<p>To get by heart his names of things. A task</p>
<p>Not easy 'tis in any wise to teach</p>
<p>And to persuade the deaf concerning what</p>
<p>'Tis needful for to do. For ne'er would they</p>
<p>Allow, nor ne'er in anywise endure</p>
<p>Perpetual vain dingdong in their ears</p>
<p>Of spoken sounds unheard before. And what,</p>
<p>At last, in this affair so wondrous is,</p>
<p>That human race (in whom a voice and tongue</p>
<p>Were now in vigour) should by divers words</p>
<p>Denote its objects, as each divers sense</p>
<p>Might prompt?- since even the speechless herds, aye, since</p>
<p>The very generations of wild beasts</p>
<p>Are wont dissimilar and divers sounds</p>
<p>To rouse from in them, when there's fear or pain,</p>
<p>And when they burst with joys. And this, forsooth,</p>
<p>'Tis thine to know from plainest facts: when first</p>
<p>Huge flabby jowls of mad Molossian hounds,</p>
<p>Baring their hard white teeth, begin to snarl,</p>
<p>They threaten, with infuriate lips peeled back,</p>
<p>In sounds far other than with which they bark</p>
<p>And fill with voices all the regions round.</p>
<p>And when with fondling tongue they start to lick</p>
<p>Their puppies, or do toss them round with paws,</p>
<p>Feigning with gentle bites to gape and snap,</p>
<p>They fawn with yelps of voice far other then</p>
<p>Than when, alone within the house, they bay,</p>
<p>Or whimpering slink with cringing sides from blows.</p>
<p>Again the neighing of the horse, is that</p>
<p>Not seen to differ likewise, when the stud</p>
<p>In buoyant flower of his young years raves,</p>
<p>Goaded by winged Love, amongst the mares,</p>
<p>And when with widening nostrils out he snorts</p>
<p>The call to battle, and when haply he</p>
<p>Whinnies at times with terror-quaking limbs?</p>
<p>Lastly, the flying race, the dappled birds,</p>
<p>Hawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, searching food and life</p>
<p>Amid the ocean billows in the brine,</p>
<p>Utter at other times far other cries</p>
<p>Than when they fight for food, or with their prey</p>
<p>Struggle and strain. And birds there are which change</p>
<p>With changing weather their own raucous songs-</p>
<p>As long-lived generations of the crows</p>
<p>Or flocks of rooks, when they be said to cry</p>
<p>For rain and water and to call at times</p>
<p>For winds and gales. Ergo, if divers moods</p>
<p>Compel the brutes, though speechless evermore,</p>
<p>To send forth divers sounds, O truly then</p>
<p>How much more likely 'twere that mortal men</p>
<p>In those days could with many a different sound</p>
<p>Denote each separate thing.</p>

<p>Concerning these affairs thou ponderest</p>
<p>In silent meditation, let me say</p>
<p>'Twas lightning brought primevally to earth</p>
<p>The fire for mortals, and from thence hath spread</p>
<p>O'er all the lands the flames of heat. For thus</p>
<p>Even now we see so many objects, touched</p>
<p>By the celestial flames, to flash aglow,</p>
<p>When thunderbolt has dowered them with heat.</p>
<p>Yet also when a many-branched tree,</p>
<p>Beaten by winds, writhes swaying to and fro,</p>
<p>Pressing 'gainst branches of a neighbour tree,</p>
<p>There by the power of mighty rub and rub</p>
<p>Is fire engendered; and at times out-flares</p>
<p>The scorching heat of flame, when boughs do chafe</p>
<p>Against the trunks. And of these causes, either</p>
<p>May well have given to mortal men the fire.</p>
<p>Next, food to cook and soften in the flame</p>

<p>By fire and new devices. Kings began</p>
<p>Cities to found and citadels to set,</p>
<p>As strongholds and asylums for themselves,</p>
<p>And flocks and fields to portion for each man</p>
<p>After the beauty, strength, and sense of each-</p>
<p>For beauty then imported much, and strength</p>
<p>Had its own rights supreme. Thereafter, wealth</p>
<p>Discovered was, and gold was brought to light,</p>
<p>Which soon of honour stripped both strong and fair;</p>
<p>For men, however beautiful in form</p>
<p>Or valorous, will follow in the main</p>
<p>The rich man's party. Yet were man to steer</p>
<p>His life by sounder reasoning, he'd own</p>
<p>Abounding riches, if with mind content</p>
<p>He lived by thrift; for never, as I guess,</p>
<p>Is there a lack of little in the world.</p>
<p>But men wished glory for themselves and power</p>
<p>Even that their fortunes on foundations firm</p>
<p>Might rest forever, and that they themselves,</p>
<p>The opulent, might pass a quiet life-</p>
<p>In vain, in vain; since, in the strife to climb</p>
<p>On to the heights of honour, men do make</p>
<p>Their pathway terrible; and even when once</p>
<p>They reach them, envy like the thunderbolt</p>
<p>At times will smite, O hurling headlong down</p>
<p>To murkiest Tartarus, in scorn; for, lo,</p>
<p>All summits, all regions loftier than the rest,</p>
<p>Smoke, blasted as by envy's thunderbolts;</p>
<p>So better far in quiet to obey,</p>

<p>And let the weary sweat their life-blood out</p>
<p>All to no end, battling in hate along</p>
<p>The narrow path of man's ambition;</p>
<p>Since all their wisdom is from others' lips,</p>
<p>And all they seek is known from what they've heard</p>
<p>And less from what they've thought. Nor is this folly</p>

<p>And crowns, so splendid on the sovereign heads,</p>
<p>Soon bloody under the proletarian feet,</p>
<p>Groaned for their glories gone- for erst o'er-much</p>

<p>Trampled beneath the rabble heel. Thus things</p>
<p>Down to the vilest lees of brawling mobs</p>
<p>Succumbed, whilst each man sought unto himself</p>
<p>Dominion and supremacy. So next</p>
<p>Some wiser heads instructed men to found</p>
<p>The magisterial office, and did frame</p>
<p>Codes that they might consent to follow laws.</p>
<p>For humankind, o'er wearied with a life</p>
<p>Fostered by force, was ailing from its feuds;</p>
<p>And so the sooner of its own free will</p>
<p>Yielded to laws and strictest codes. For since</p>
<p>Each hand made ready in its wrath to take</p>
<p>A vengeance fiercer than by man's fair laws</p>
<p>Is now conceded, men on this account</p>
<p>Loathed the old life fostered by force. 'Tis thence</p>
<p>That fear of punishments defiles each prize</p>
<p>Of wicked days; for force and fraud ensnare</p>

<p>And men would give them an eternal life,</p>
<p>Because their visages forevermore</p>

<p>Unto divinities, and in feigning all</p>
<p>Was guided by their nod. And in the sky</p>
<p>They set the seats and vaults of gods, because</p>
<p>Across the sky night and the moon are seen</p>

<p>And across the mighty sky the rumblings run?</p>
<p>Do not the peoples and the nations shake,</p>

<p rend="indent">  Now for the rest: copper and gold and iron</p>
<p>Discovered were, and with them silver's weight</p>
<p>And power of lead, when with prodigious heat</p>
<p>The conflagrations burned the forest trees</p>
<p>Among the mighty mountains, by a bolt</p>
<p>Of lightning from the sky, or else because</p>
<p>Men, warring in the woodlands, on their foes</p>
<p>Had hurled fire to frighten and dismay,</p>
<p>Or yet because, by goodness of the soil</p>
<p>Invited, men desired to clear rich fields</p>
<p>And turn the countryside to pasture-lands,</p>
<p>Or slay the wild and thrive upon the spoils.</p>
<p>(For hunting by pit-fall and by fire arose</p>
<p>Before the art of hedging the covert round</p>
<p>With net or stirring it with dogs of chase.)</p>
<p>Howso the fact, and from what cause soever</p>
<p>The flamy heat with awful crack and roar</p>
<p>Had there devoured to their deepest roots</p>
<p>The forest trees and baked the earth with fire,</p>
<p>Then from the boiling veins began to ooze</p>
<p>O rivulets of silver and of gold,</p>
<p>Of lead and copper too, collecting soon</p>
<p>Into the hollow places of the ground.</p>
<p>And when men saw the cooled lumps anon</p>
<p>To shine with splendour-sheen upon the ground,</p>
<p>Much taken with that lustrous smooth delight,</p>
<p>They 'gan to pry them out, and saw how each</p>
<p>Had got a shape like to its earthy mould.</p>
<p>Then would it enter their heads how these same lumps,</p>
<p>If melted by heat, could into any form</p>
<p>Or figure of things be run, and how, again,</p>
<p>If hammered out, they could be nicely drawn</p>
<p>To sharpest points or finest edge, and thus</p>
<p>Yield to the forgers tools and give them power</p>
<p>To chop the forest down, to hew the logs,</p>
<p>To shave the beams and planks, besides to bore</p>
<p>And punch and drill. And men began such work</p>
<p>At first as much with tools of silver and gold</p>
<p>As with the impetuous strength of the stout copper;</p>

<p>And gold lay useless, blunted with dull edge.</p>
<p>Now lies the copper low, and gold hath come</p>

<p rend="indent">                             Now, Memmius,</p>
<p>How nature of iron discovered was, thou mayst</p>
<p>Of thine own self divine. Man's ancient arms</p>
<p>Were hands, and nails and teeth, stones too and boughs-</p>
<p>Breakage of forest trees- and flame and fire,</p>
<p>As soon as known. Thereafter force of iron</p>
<p>And copper discovered was; and copper's use</p>
<p>Was known ere iron's, since more tractable</p>
<p>Its nature is and its abundance more.</p>
<p>With copper men to work the soil began,</p>
<p>With copper to rouse the hurly waves of war,</p>
<p>To straw the monstrous wounds, and seize away</p>
<p>Another's flocks and fields. For unto them,</p>
<p>Thus armed, all things naked of defence</p>
<p>Readily yielded. Then by slow degrees</p>
<p>The sword of iron succeeded, and the shape</p>
<p>Of brazen sickle into scorn was turned:</p>
<p>With iron to cleave the soil of earth they 'gan,</p>
<p>And the contentions of uncertain war</p>
<p>Were rendered equal.</p>
<p rend="indent">                     And, lo, man was wont</p>
<p>Armed to mount upon the ribs of horse</p>
<p>And guide him with the rein, and play about</p>
<p>With right hand free, oft times before he tried</p>
<p>Perils of war in yoked chariot;</p>
<p>And yoked pairs abreast came earlier</p>
<p>Than yokes of four, or scythed chariots</p>
<p>Whereinto clomb the men-at-arms. And next</p>
<p>The Punic folk did train the elephants-</p>
<p>Those curst Lucanian oxen, hideous,</p>
<p>The serpent-handed, with turrets on their bulks-</p>
<p>To dure the wounds of war and panic-strike</p>
<p>The mighty troops of <placeName key="tgn,2008886">Mars</placeName>. Thus Discord sad</p>
<p>Begat the one Thing after other, to be</p>
<p>The terror of the nations under arms,</p>
<p>And day by day to horrors of old war</p>
<p>She added an increase.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1308"/>
<p rend="indent">                      Bulls, too, they tried</p>
<p>In war's grim business; and essayed to send</p>
<p>Outrageous boars against the foes. And some</p>
<p>Sent on before their ranks puissant lions</p>
<p>With armed trainers and with masters fierce</p>
<p>To guide and hold in chains- and yet in vain,</p>
<p>Since fleshed with pell-mell slaughter, fierce they flew,</p>
<p>And blindly through the squadrons havoc wrought,</p>
<p>Shaking the frightful crests upon their heads,</p>
<p>Now here, now there. Nor could the horsemen calm</p>
<p>Their horses, panic-breasted at the roar,</p>
<p>And rein them round to front the foe. With spring</p>
<p>The infuriate she-lions would up-leap</p>
<p>Now here, now there; and whoso came apace</p>
<p>Against them, these they'd rend across the face;</p>
<p>And others unwitting from behind they'd tear</p>
<p>Down from their mounts, and twining round them, bring</p>
<p>Tumbling to earth, o'ermastered by the wound,</p>
<p>And with those powerful fangs and hooked claws</p>
<p>Fasten upon them. Bulls would toss their friends,</p>
<p>And trample under foot, and from beneath</p>
<p>Rip flanks and bellies of horses with their horns,</p>
<p>And with a threat'ning forehead jam the sod;</p>
<p>And boars would gore with stout tusks their allies,</p>
<p>Splashing in fury their own blood on spears</p>
<p>Splintered in their own bodies, and would fell</p>
<p>In rout and ruin infantry and horse.</p>
<p>For there the beasts-of-saddle tried to scape</p>
<p>The savage thrusts of tusk by shying off,</p>
<p>Or rearing up with hoofs a-paw in air.</p>
<p>In vain- since there thou mightest see them sink,</p>
<p>Their sinews severed, and with heavy fall</p>
<p>Bestrew the ground. And such of these as men</p>
<p>Supposed well-trained long ago at home,</p>
<p>Were in the thick of action seen to foam</p>
<p>In fury, from the wounds, the shrieks, the flight,</p>
<p>The panic, and the tumult; nor could men</p>
<p>Aught of their numbers rally. For each breed</p>
<p>And various of the wild beasts fled apart</p>
<p>Hither or thither, as often in wars to-day</p>
<p>Flee those Lucanian oxen, by the steel</p>
<p>Grievously mangled, after they have wrought</p>
<p>Upon their friends so many a dreadful doom.</p>
<p>(If 'twas, indeed, that thus they did at all:</p>
<p>But scarcely I'll believe that men could not</p>
<p>With mind foreknow and see, as sure to come,</p>
<p>Such foul and general disaster.- This</p>
<p>We, then, may hold as true in the great All,</p>
<p>In divers worlds on divers plan create,-</p>
<p>Somewhere afar more likely than upon</p>
<p>One certain earth.) But men chose this to do</p>
<p>Less in the hope of conquering than to give</p>
<p>Their enemies a goodly cause of woe,</p>
<p>Even though thereby they perished themselves,</p>
<p>Since weak in numbers and since wanting arms.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Now, clothes of roughly inter-plaited strands</p>
<p>Were earlier than loom-wove coverings;</p>
<p>The loom-wove later than man's iron is,</p>
<p>Since iron is needful in the weaving art,</p>
<p>Nor by no other means can there be wrought</p>
<p>Such polished tools- the treadles, spindles, shuttles,</p>
<p>And sounding yarn-beams. And nature forced the men,</p>
<p>Before the woman kind, to work the wool:</p>
<p>For all the male kind far excels in skill,</p>
<p>And cleverer is by much- until at last</p>
<p>The rugged farmer folk jeered at such tasks,</p>
<p>And so were eager soon to give them o'er</p>
<p>To women's hands, and in more hardy toil</p>
<p>To harden arms and hands.</p>

<p rend="indent">                      But nature herself,</p>

<p>Dropping from off the trees, would there beneath</p>
<p>Put forth in season swarms of little shoots;</p>
<p>Hence too men's fondness for ingrafting slips</p>
<p>Upon the boughs and setting out in holes</p>
<p>The young shrubs o'er the fields. Then would they try</p>
<p>Ever new modes of tilling their loved crofts,</p>
<p>And mark they would how earth improved the taste</p>
<p>Of the wild fruits by fond and fostering care.</p>
<p>And day by day they'd force the woods to move</p>
<p>Still higher up the mountain, and to yield</p>
<p>The place below for tilth, that there they might,</p>
<p>On plains and uplands, have their meadow-plats,</p>
<p>Cisterns and runnels, crops of standing grain,</p>
<p>And happy vineyards, and that all along</p>
<p>O'er hillocks, intervales, and plains might run</p>

<p>By measured song, melodious verse and give</p>
<p>Delight to ears. And whistlings of the wind</p>
<p>Athrough the hollows of the reeds first taught</p>
<p>The peasantry to blow into the stalks</p>
<p>Of hollow hemlock-herb. Then bit by bit</p>

<p>Little by little unto the midst of men,</p>
<p>And reason uplifts it to the shores of light.</p>
<p>These tunes would soothe and glad the minds of mortals</p>
<p>When sated with food,- for songs are welcome then.</p>
<p>And often, lounging with friends in the soft grass</p>
<p>Beside a river of water, underneath</p>
<p>A big tree's branches, merrily they'd refresh</p>
<p>Their frames, with no vast outlay- most of all</p>
<p>If the weather were smiling and the times of the year</p>
<p>Were painting the green of the grass around with flowers.</p>
<p>Then jokes, then talk, then peals of jollity</p>
<p>Would circle round; for then the rustic muse</p>
<p>Was in her glory; then would antic Mirth</p>
<p>Prompt them to garland head and shoulders about</p>
<p>With chaplets of intertwined flowers and leaves,</p>
<p>And to dance onward, out of tune, with limbs</p>
<p>Clownishly swaying, and with clownish foot</p>
<p>To beat our mother earth- from whence arose</p>
<p>Laughter and peals of jollity, for, lo,</p>
<p>Such frolic acts were in their glory then,</p>
<p>Being more new and strange. And wakeful men</p>
<p>Found solaces for their unsleeping hours</p>
<p>In drawing forth variety of notes,</p>
<p>In modulating melodies, in running</p>
<p>With puckered lips along the tuned reeds,</p>
<p>Whence, even in our day do the watchmen guard</p>
<p>These old traditions, and have learned well</p>
<p>To keep true measure. And yet they no whit</p>
<p>Do get a larger fruit of gladsomeness</p>
<p>Than got the woodland aborigines</p>
<p>In olden times. For what we have at hand-</p>

<p>'Twas Athens first, the glorious in name,</p>
<p>That whilom gave to hapless sons of men</p>
<p>The sheaves of harvest, and re-ordered life,</p>
<p>And decreed laws; and she the first that gave</p>
<p>Life its sweet solaces, when she begat</p>
<p>A man of heart so wise, who whilom poured</p>
<p>All wisdom forth from his truth-speaking mouth;</p>
<p>The glory of whom, though dead, is yet to-day,</p>
<p>Because of those discoveries divine</p>
<p>Renowned of old, exalted to the sky.</p>
<p>For when saw he that well-nigh everything</p>
<p>Which needs of man most urgently require</p>
<p>Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life,</p>
<p>As far as might be, was established safe,</p>
<p>That men were lords in riches, honour, praise,</p>
<p>And eminent in goodly fame of sons,</p>
<p>And that they yet, O yet, within the home,</p>
<p>Still had the anxious heart which vexed life</p>
<p>Unpausingly with torments of the mind,</p>
<p>And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he,</p>
<p>Then he, the master, did perceive that 'twas</p>
<p>The vessel itself which worked the bane, and all,</p>
<p>However wholesome, which from here or there</p>
<p>Was gathered into it, was by that bane</p>
<p>Spoilt from within,- in part, because he saw</p>
<p>The vessel so cracked and leaky that nowise</p>
<p>'T could ever be filled to brim; in part because</p>
<p>He marked how it polluted with foul taste</p>
<p>Whate'er it got within itself. So he,</p>
<p>The master, then by his truth-speaking words,</p>
<p>Purged the breasts of men, and set the bounds</p>
<p>Of lust and terror, and exhibited</p>
<p>The supreme good whither we all endeavour,</p>
<p>And showed the path whereby we might arrive</p>
<p>Thereunto by a little cross-cut straight,</p>
<p>And what of ills in all affairs of mortals</p>
<p>Upsprang and flitted deviously about</p>
<p>(Whether by chance or force), since nature thus</p>
<p>Had destined; and from out what gates a man</p>
<p>Should sally to each combat. And he proved</p>
<p>That mostly vainly doth the human race</p>
<p>Roll in its bosom the grim waves of care.</p>
<p>For just as children tremble and fear all</p>
<p>In the viewless dark, so even we at times</p>
<p>Dread in the light so many things that be</p>
<p>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</p>
<p>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</p>
<p>This terror then, this darkness of the mind,</p>
<p>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</p>
<p>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</p>

<p>Because the ethereal clouds, scudding aloft,</p>
<p>Together clash, what time 'gainst one another</p>
<p>The winds are battling. For never a sound there comes</p>
<p>From out the serene regions of the sky;</p>
<p>But wheresoever in a host more dense</p>
<p>The clouds foregather, thence more often comes</p>
<p>A crash with mighty rumbling. And, again,</p>
<p>Clouds cannot be of so condensed a frame</p>
<p>As stones and timbers, nor again so fine</p>
<p>As mists and flying smoke; for then perforce</p>
<p>They'd either fall, borne down by their brute weight,</p>
<p>Like stones, or, like the smoke, they'd powerless be</p>

<p>Frore snows and storms of hail. And they give forth</p>
<p>O'er skiey levels of the spreading world</p>
<p>A sound on high, as linen-awning, stretched</p>

<p>For sometimes, too, it chances that the clouds</p>
<p>Cannot together crash head-on, but rather</p>
<p>Move side-wise and with motions contrary</p>
<p>Graze each the other's body without speed,</p>

<p>To grow all hollow with a thickened crust</p>
<p>Surrounding; for thereafter, when the force</p>
<p>And the keen onset of the wind have weakened</p>
<p>That crust, lo, then the cloud, to-split in twain,</p>
<p>Gives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom.</p>
<p>No marvel this; since oft a bladder small,</p>
<p>Filled up with air, will, when of sudden burst,</p>
<p>Give forth a like large sound.</p>
<p rend="indent">                             There's reason, too,</p>
<p>Why clouds make sounds, as through them blow the winds:</p>

<p>Rough-edged or branched many forky ways;</p>
<p>And 'tis the same, as when the sudden flaws</p>
<p>Of north-west wind through the dense forest blow,</p>
<p>Making the leaves to sough and limbs to crash.</p>
<p>It happens too at times that roused force</p>
<p>Of the fierce hurricane to-rends the cloud,</p>
<p>Breaking right through it by a front assault;</p>
<p>For what a blast of wind may do up there</p>
<p>Is manifest from facts when here on earth</p>
<p>A blast more gentle yet uptwists tall trees</p>

<p>Likewise, it lightens, when the clouds have struck,</p>

<p>With double-edged ax, it comes to pass</p>
<p>Thine eye beholds the swinging stroke before</p>
<p>The blow gives forth a sound athrough thine ears:</p>
<p>Thus also we behold the flashing ere</p>
<p>We hear the thunder, which discharged is</p>
<p>At same time with the fire and by same cause,</p>
<p>Born of the same collision.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="173"/>
<p rend="indent">                             In following wise</p>
<p>The clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands,</p>
<p>And the storm flashes with tremulous elan:</p>
<p>When the wind hath invaded a cloud, and, whirling there,</p>
<p>Hath wrought (as I have shown above) the cloud</p>
<p>Into a hollow with a thickened crust,</p>
<p>It becomes hot of own velocity:</p>
<p>Just as thou seest how motion will o'erheat</p>
<p>And set ablaze all objects,- verily</p>
<p>A leaden ball, hurtling through length of space,</p>
<p>Even melts. Therefore, when this same wind a-fire</p>
<p>Hath split black cloud, it scatters the fire-seeds,</p>
<p>Which, so to say, have been pressed out by force</p>
<p>Of sudden from the cloud;- and these do make</p>
<p>The pulsing flashes of flame; thence followeth</p>
<p>The detonation which attacks our ears</p>
<p>More tardily than aught which comes along</p>
<p>Unto the sight of eyeballs. This takes place-</p>
<p>As know thou mayst- at times when clouds are dense</p>
<p>And one upon the other piled aloft</p>
<p>With wonderful upheavings- nor be thou</p>
<p>Deceived because we see how broad their base</p>
<p>From underneath, and not how high they tower.</p>
<p>For make thine observations at a time</p>
<p>When winds shall bear athwart the horizon's blue</p>
<p>Clouds like to mountain-ranges moving on,</p>
<p>Or when about the sides of mighty peaks</p>
<p>Thou seest them one upon the other massed</p>
<p>And burdening downward, anchored in high repose,</p>
<p>With the winds sepulchred on all sides round:</p>
<p>Then canst thou know their mighty masses, then</p>
<p>Canst view their caverns, as if builded there</p>
<p>Of beetling crags; which, when the hurricanes</p>
<p>In gathered storm have filled utterly,</p>
<p>Then, prisoned in clouds, they rave around</p>
<p>With mighty roarings, and within those dens</p>
<p>Bluster like savage beasts, and now from here,</p>
<p>And now from there, send growlings through the clouds,</p>
<p>And seeking an outlet, whirl themselves about,</p>
<p>And roll from 'mid the clouds the seeds of fire,</p>
<p>And heap them multitudinously there,</p>
<p>And in the hollow furnaces within</p>
<p>Wheel flame around, until from bursted cloud</p>
<p>In forky flashes they have gleamed forth.</p>

<p rend="indent">  Again, from following cause it comes to pass</p>
<p>That yon swift golden hue of liquid fire</p>
<p>Darts downward to the earth: because the clouds</p>
<p>Themselves must hold abundant seeds of fire;</p>
<p>For, when they be without all moisture, then</p>
<p>They be for most part of a flamy hue</p>
<p>And a resplendent. And, indeed, they must</p>
<p>Even from the light of sun unto themselves</p>
<p>Take multitudinous seeds, and so perforce</p>
<p>Redden and pour their bright fires all abroad.</p>
<p>And therefore, when the wind hath driven and thrust,</p>
<p>Hath forced and squeezed into one spot these clouds,</p>
<p>They pour abroad the seeds of fire pressed out,</p>
<p>Which make to flash these colours of the flame.</p>
<p>Likewise, it lightens also when the clouds</p>
<p>Grow rare and thin along the sky; for, when</p>
<p>The wind with gentle touch unravels them</p>
<p>And breaketh asunder as they move, those seeds</p>
<p>Which make the lightnings must by nature fall;</p>
<p>At such an hour the horizon lightens round</p>

<p>Subtler than fires all other, with minute</p>
<p>And dartling bodies,- a fire 'gainst which there's naught</p>
<p>Can in the least hold out: the thunderbolt,</p>

<p>As all begotten in those crasser clouds</p>
<p>Up-piled aloft; for, from the sky serene</p>
<p>And from the clouds of lighter density,</p>
<p>None are sent forth forever. That 'tis so</p>
<p>Beyond a doubt, fact plain to sense declares:</p>
<p>To wit, at such a time the densed clouds</p>
<p>So mass themselves through all the upper air</p>
<p>That we might think that round about all murk</p>
<p>Had parted forth from Acheron and filled</p>
<p>The mighty vaults of sky- so grievously,</p>
<p>As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome might,</p>
<p>Do faces of black horror hang on high-</p>
<p>When tempest begins its thunderbolts to forge.</p>
<p>Besides, full often also out at sea</p>
<p>A blackest thunderhead, like cataract</p>
<p>Of pitch hurled down from heaven, and far away</p>
<p>Bulging with murkiness, down on the waves</p>
<p>Falls with vast uproar, and draws on amain</p>
<p>The darkling tempests big with thunderbolts</p>
<p>And hurricanes, itself the while so crammed</p>
<p>Tremendously with fires and winds, that even</p>
<p>Back on the lands the people shudder round</p>
<p>And seek for cover. Therefore, as I said,</p>
<p>The storm must be conceived as o'er our head</p>
<p>Towering most high; for never would the clouds</p>
<p>O'erwhelm the lands with such a massy dark,</p>
<p>Unless up-builded heap on lofty heap,</p>
<p>To shut the round sun off. Nor could the clouds,</p>
<p>As on they come, engulf with rain so vast</p>
<p>As thus to make the rivers overflow</p>
<p>And fields to float, if ether were not thus</p>
<p>Furnished with lofty-piled clouds. Lo, then,</p>
<p>Here be all things fulfilled with winds and fires-</p>
<p>Hence the long lightnings and the thunders loud.</p>
<p>For, verily, I've taught thee even now</p>
<p>How cavernous clouds hold seeds innumerable</p>
<p>Of fiery exhalations, and they must</p>
<p>From off the sunbeams and the heat of these</p>
<p>Take many still. And so, when that same wind</p>
<p>(Which, haply, into one region of the sky</p>
<p>Collects those clouds) hath pressed from out the same</p>
<p>The many fiery seeds, and with that fire</p>
<p>Hath at the same time inter-mixed itself,</p>
<p>O then and there that wind, a whirlwind now,</p>
<p>Deep in the belly of the cloud spins round</p>
<p>In narrow confines, and sharpens there inside</p>
<p>In glowing furnaces the thunderbolt.</p>
<p>For in a two-fold manner is that wind</p>
<p>Enkindled all: it trembles into heat</p>
<p>Both by its own velocity and by</p>
<p>Repeated touch of fire. Thereafter, when</p>
<p>The energy of wind is heated through</p>
<p>And the fierce impulse of the fire hath sped</p>
<p>Deeply within, O then the thunderbolt,</p>
<p>Now ripened, so to say, doth suddenly</p>
<p>Splinter the cloud, and the aroused flash</p>
<p>Leaps onward, lumining with forky light</p>
<p>All places round. And followeth anon</p>
<p>A clap so heavy that the skiey vaults,</p>
<p>As if asunder burst, seem from on high</p>
<p>To engulf the earth. Then fearfully a quake</p>
<p>Pervades the lands, and 'long the lofty skies</p>
<p>Run the far rumblings. For at such a time</p>
<p>Nigh the whole tempest quakes, shook through and through,</p>
<p>And roused are the roarings,- from which shock</p>
<p>Comes such resounding and abounding rain,</p>
<p>That all the murky ether seems to turn</p>
<p>Now into rain, and, as it tumbles down,</p>
<p>To summon the fields back to primeval floods:</p>
<p>So big the rains that be sent down on men</p>
<p>By burst of cloud and by the hurricane,</p>
<p>What time the thunder-clap, from burning bolt</p>
<p>That cracks the cloud, flies forth along. At times</p>
<p>The force of wind, excited from without,</p>
<p>Smiteth into a cloud already hot</p>
<p>With a ripe thunderbolt.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="295"/>
<p rend="indent">And when that wind</p>
<p>Hath splintered that cloud, then down there cleaves forthwith</p>
<p>Yon fiery coil of flame which still we call,</p>
<p>Even with our fathers' word, a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>The same thing haps toward every other side</p>
<p>Whither that force hath swept. It happens, too,</p>
<p>That sometimes force of wind, though hurtled forth</p>
<p>Without all fire, yet in its voyage through space</p>
<p>Igniteth, whilst it comes along, along,-</p>
<p>Losing some larger bodies which cannot</p>
<p>Pass, like the others, through the bulks of air,-</p>
<p>And, scraping together out of air itself</p>
<p>Some smaller bodies, carries them along,</p>
<p>And these, commingling, by their flight make fire:</p>
<p>Much in the manner as oft a leaden ball</p>
<p>Grows hot upon its aery course, the while</p>
<p>It loseth many bodies of stark cold</p>
<p>And taketh into itself along the air</p>
<p>New particles of fire. It happens, too,</p>
<p>That force of blow itself arouses fire,</p>
<p>When force of wind, a-cold and hurtled forth</p>
<p>Without all fire, hath strook somewhere amain-</p>
<p>No marvel, because, when with terrific stroke</p>

<p>And therefore, thuswise must an object too</p>
<p>Be kindled by a thunderbolt, if haply</p>
<p>'Thas been adapt and suited to the flames.</p>
<p>Yet force of wind must not be rashly deemed</p>
<p>As altogether and entirely cold-</p>
<p>That force which is discharged from on high</p>
<p>With such stupendous power; but if 'tis not</p>
<p>Upon its course already kindled with fire,</p>
<p>It yet arriveth warmed and mixed with heat.</p>

<p rend="indent">  And, now, the speed and stroke of thunderbolt</p>
<p>Is so tremendous, and with glide so swift</p>
<p>Those thunderbolts rush on and down, because</p>
<p>Their roused force itself collects itself</p>
<p>First always in the clouds, and then prepares</p>
<p>For the huge effort of their going-forth;</p>
<p>Next, when the cloud no longer can retain</p>
<p>The increment of their fierce impetus,</p>
<p>Their force is pressed out, and therefore flies</p>
<p>With impetus so wondrous, like to shots</p>
<p>Hurled from the powerful Roman catapults.</p>
<p>Note, too, this force consists of elements</p>
<p>Both small and smooth, nor is there aught that can</p>
<p>With ease resist such nature. For it darts</p>
<p>Between and enters through the pores of things;</p>
<p>And so it never falters in delay</p>
<p>Despite innumerable collisions, but</p>
<p>Flies shooting onward with a swift elan.</p>
<p>Next, since by nature always every weight</p>
<p>Bears downward, doubled is the swiftness then</p>
<p>And that elan is still more wild and dread,</p>
<p>When, verily, to weight are added blows,</p>
<p>So that more madly and more fiercely then</p>
<p>The thunderbolt shakes into shivers all</p>
<p>That blocks its path, following on its way.</p>
<p>Then, too, because it comes along, along</p>
<p>With one continuing elan, it must</p>
<p>Take on velocity anew, anew,</p>
<p>Which still increases as it goes, and ever</p>
<p>Augments the bolt's vast powers and to the blow</p>
<p>Gives larger vigour; for it forces all,</p>
<p>All of the thunder's seeds of fire, to sweep</p>
<p>In a straight line unto one place, as 'twere,-</p>
<p>Casting them one by other, as they roll,</p>
<p>Into that onward course. Again, perchance,</p>
<p>In coming along, it pulls from out the air</p>
<p>Some certain bodies, which by their own blows</p>
<p>Enkindle its velocity. And, lo,</p>
<p>It comes through objects leaving them unharmed,</p>
<p>It goes through many things and leaves them whole,</p>
<p>Because the liquid fire flieth along</p>
<p>Athrough their pores. And much it does transfix,</p>
<p>When these primordial atoms of the bolt</p>
<p>Have fallen upon the atoms of these things</p>
<p>Precisely where the intertwined atoms</p>
<p>Are held together. And, further, easily</p>
<p>Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold,</p>
<p>Because its force is so minutely made</p>
<p>Of tiny parts and elements so smooth</p>
<p>That easily they wind their way within,</p>
<p>And, when once in, quickly unbind all knots</p>

<p>Of the high heaven have gathered suddenly,</p>
<p>As round they flew, unnumbered particles-</p>
<p>World's rougher ones, which can, though interlinked</p>
<p>With scanty couplings, yet be fastened firm,</p>
<p>The one on other caught. These particles</p>
<p>First cause small clouds to form; and, thereupon,</p>
<p>These catch the one on other and swarm in a flock</p>
<p>And grow by their conjoining, and by winds</p>
<p>Are borne along, along, until collects</p>
<p>The tempest fury. Happens, too, the nearer</p>
<p>The mountain summits neighbour to the sky,</p>
<p>The more unceasingly their far crags smoke</p>
<p>With the thick darkness of swart cloud, because</p>
<p>When first the mists do form, ere ever the eyes</p>
<p>Can there behold them (tenuous as they be),</p>
<p>The carrier-winds will drive them up and on</p>
<p>Unto the topmost summits of the mountain;</p>
<p>And then at last it happens, when they be</p>
<p>In vaster throng upgathered, that they can</p>
<p>By this very condensation lie revealed,</p>
<p>And that at same time they are seen to surge</p>
<p>From very vertex of the mountain up</p>
<p>Into far ether. For very fact and feeling,</p>
<p>As we up-climb high mountains, proveth clear</p>
<p>That windy are those upward regions free.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="470"/>
<p>Besides, the clothes hung-out along the shore,</p>
<p>When in they take the clinging moisture, prove</p>
<p>That nature lifts from over all the sea</p>
<p>Unnumbered particles. Whereby the more</p>
<p>'Tis manifest that many particles</p>
<p>Even from the salt upheavings of the main</p>
<p>Can rise together to augment the bulk</p>
<p>Of massed clouds. For moistures in these twain</p>
<p>Are near akin. Besides, from out all rivers,</p>
<p>As well as from the land itself, we see</p>
<p>Up-rising mists and steam, which like a breath</p>
<p>Are forced out from them and borne aloft,</p>
<p>To curtain heaven with their murk, and make,</p>
<p>By slow foregathering, the skiey clouds.</p>
<p>For, in addition, lo, the heat on high</p>
<p>Of constellated ether burdens down</p>
<p>Upon them, and by sort of condensation</p>
<p>Weaveth beneath the azure firmament</p>
<p>The reek of darkling cloud. It happens, too,</p>
<p>That hither to the skies from the Beyond</p>
<p>Do come those particles which make the clouds</p>
<p>And flying thunderheads. For I have taught</p>
<p>That this their number is innumerable</p>
<p>And infinite the sum of the Abyss,</p>
<p>And I have shown with what stupendous speed</p>
<p>Those bodies fly and how they're wont to pass</p>
<p>Amain through incommunicable space.</p>
<p>Therefore, 'tis not exceeding strange, if oft</p>
<p>In little time tempest and darkness cover</p>
<p>With bulking thunderheads hanging on high</p>
<p>The oceans and the lands, since everywhere</p>
<p>Through all the narrow tubes of yonder ether,</p>
<p>Yea, so to speak, through all the breathing-holes</p>
<p>Of the great upper-world encompassing,</p>
<p>There be for the primordial elements</p>
<p>Exits and entrances.</p>

<p rend="indent">                       Now come, and how</p>
<p>The rainy moisture thickens into being</p>
<p>In the lofty clouds, and how upon the lands</p>
<p>'Tis then discharged in down-pour of large showers,</p>
<p>I will unfold. And first triumphantly</p>
<p>Will I persuade thee that up-rise together,</p>
<p>With clouds themselves, full many seeds of water</p>
<p>From out all things, and that they both increase-</p>
<p>Both clouds and water which is in the clouds-</p>
<p>In like proportion, as our frames increase</p>
<p>In like proportion with our blood, as well</p>
<p>As sweat or any moisture in our members.</p>
<p>Besides, the clouds take in from time to time</p>
<p>Much moisture risen from the broad marine,-</p>
<p>Whilst the winds bear them o'er the mighty sea,</p>
<p>Like hanging fleeces of white wool. Thuswise,</p>
<p>Even from all rivers is there lifted up</p>
<p>Moisture into the clouds. And when therein</p>
<p>The seeds of water so many in many ways</p>
<p>Have come together, augmented from all sides,</p>
<p>The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge</p>
<p>Their rain-storms for a two-fold reason: lo,</p>
<p>The wind's force crowds them, and the very excess</p>
<p>Of storm-clouds (massed in a vaster throng)</p>
<p>Giveth an urge and pressure from above</p>
<p>And makes the rains out-pour. Besides when, too,</p>
<p>The clouds are winnowed by the winds, or scattered</p>
<p>Smitten on top by heat of sun, they send</p>
<p>Their rainy moisture, and distil their drops,</p>
<p>Even as the wax, by fiery warmth on top,</p>
<p>Wasteth and liquefies abundantly.</p>
<p>But comes the violence of the bigger rains</p>
<p>When violently the clouds are weighted down</p>
<p>Both by their cumulated mass and by</p>
<p>The onset of the wind. And rains are wont</p>
<p>To endure awhile and to abide for long,</p>
<p>When many seeds of waters are aroused,</p>
<p>And clouds on clouds and racks on racks outstream</p>
<p>In piled layers and are borne along</p>
<p>From every quarter, and when all the earth</p>
<p>Smoking exhales her moisture. At such a time</p>
<p>When sun with beams amid the tempest-murk</p>
<p>Hath shone against the showers of black rains,</p>
<p>Then in the swart clouds there emerges bright</p>
<p>The radiance of the bow.</p>

<p>Not mentioned here which of themselves do grow</p>

<p>Which in the clouds condense to being- all,</p>
<p>Snow and the winds, hail and the hoar-frosts chill,</p>
<p>And freezing, mighty force- of lakes and pools</p>
<p>The mighty hardener, and mighty check</p>
<p>Which in the winter curbeth everywhere</p>
<p>The rivers as they go- 'tis easy still,</p>
<p>Soon to discover and with mind to see</p>
<p>How they all happen, whereby gendered,</p>

<p>Now come, and what the law of earthquakes is</p>
<p>Hearken, and first of all take care to know</p>
<p>That the under-earth, like to the earth around us,</p>
<p>Is full of windy caverns all about;</p>
<p>And many a pool and many a grim abyss</p>
<p>She bears within her bosom, ay, and cliffs</p>
<p>And jagged scarps; and many a river, hid</p>
<p>Beneath her chine, rolls rapidly along</p>
<p>Its billows and plunging boulders. For clear fact</p>
<p>Requires that earth must be in every part</p>
<p>Alike in constitution. Therefore, earth,</p>
<p>With these things underneath affixed and set,</p>
<p>Trembleth above, jarred by big down-tumblings,</p>
<p>When time hath undermined the huge caves,</p>
<p>The subterranean. Yea, whole mountains fall,</p>
<p>And instantly from spot of that big jar</p>
<p>There quiver the tremors far and wide abroad.</p>
<p>And with good reason: since houses on the street</p>
<p>Begin to quake throughout, when jarred by a cart</p>
<p>Of no large weight; and, too, the furniture</p>
<p>Within the house up-bounds, when a paving-block</p>
<p>Gives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt.</p>
<p>It happens, too, when some prodigious bulk</p>
<p>Of age-worn soil is rolled from mountain slopes</p>
<p>Into tremendous pools of water dark,</p>
<p>That the reeling land itself is rocked about</p>
<p>By the water's undulations; as a basin</p>
<p>Sometimes won't come to rest until the fluid</p>
<p>Within it ceases to be rocked about</p>
<p>In random undulations.</p>
<p rend="indent">                            And besides,</p>
<p>When subterranean winds, up-gathered there</p>
<p>In the hollow deeps, bulk forward from one spot,</p>
<p>And press with the big urge of mighty powers</p>
<p>Against the lofty grottos, then the earth</p>
<p>Bulks to that quarter whither push amain</p>
<p>The headlong winds. Then all the builded houses</p>
<p>Above ground- and the more, the higher up-reared</p>
<p>Unto the sky- lean ominously, careening</p>
<p>Into the same direction; and the beams,</p>
<p>Wrenched forward, over-hang, ready to go.</p>
<p>Yet dread men to believe that there awaits</p>
<p>The nature of the mighty world a time</p>
<p>Of doom and cataclysm, albeit they see</p>
<p>So great a bulk of lands to bulge and break!</p>
<p>And lest the winds blew back again, no force</p>
<p>Could rein things in nor hold from sure career</p>
<p>On to disaster. But now because those winds</p>
<p>Blow back and forth in alternation strong,</p>
<p>And, so to say, rallying charge again,</p>
<p>And then repulsed retreat, on this account</p>
<p>Earth oftener threatens than she brings to pass</p>
<p>Collapses dire. For to one side she leans,</p>
<p>Then back she sways; and after tottering</p>
<p>Forward, recovers then her seats of poise.</p>
<p>Thus, this is why whole houses rock, the roofs</p>
<p>More than the middle stories, middle more</p>
<p>Than lowest, and the lowest least of all.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="577"/>
<p rend="indent">  Arises, too, this same great earth-quaking,</p>
<p>When wind and some prodigious force of air,</p>
<p>Collected from without or down within</p>
<p>The old telluric deeps, have hurled themselves</p>
<p>Amain into those caverns sub-terrene,</p>
<p>And there at first tumultuously chafe</p>
<p>Among the vasty grottos, borne about</p>
<p>In mad rotations, till their lashed force</p>
<p>Aroused out-bursts abroad, and then and there,</p>
<p>Riving the deep earth, makes a mighty chasm-</p>
<p>What once in Syrian Sidon did befall,</p>
<p>And once in Peloponnesian Aegium,</p>
<p>Twain cities which such out-break of wild air</p>
<p>And earth's convulsion, following hard upon,</p>
<p>O'erthrew of old. And many a walled town,</p>
<p>Besides, hath fall'n by such omnipotent</p>
<p>Convulsions on the land, and in the sea</p>
<p>Engulfed hath sunken many a city down</p>
<p>With all its populace. But if, indeed,</p>
<p>They burst not forth, yet is the very rush</p>
<p>Of the wild air and fury-force of wind</p>
<p>Then dissipated, like an ague-fit,</p>
<p>Through the innumerable pores of earth,</p>
<p>To set her all a-shake- even as a chill,</p>
<p>When it hath gone into our marrow-bones,</p>
<p>Sets us convulsively, despite ourselves,</p>
<p>A-shivering and a-shaking. Therefore, men</p>
<p>With two-fold terror bustle in alarm</p>
<p>Through cities to and fro: they fear the roofs</p>
<p>Above the head; and underfoot they dread</p>
<p>The caverns, lest the nature of the earth</p>
<p>Suddenly rend them open, and she gape,</p>
<p>Herself asunder, with tremendous maw,</p>
<p>And, all confounded, seek to chock it full</p>
<p>With her own ruins. Let men, then, go on</p>
<p>Feigning at will that heaven and earth shall be</p>
<p>Inviolable, entrusted evermore</p>
<p>To an eternal weal: and yet at times</p>
<p>The very force of danger here at hand</p>
<p>Prods them on some side with this goad of fear-</p>
<p>This among others- that the earth, withdrawn</p>
<p>Abruptly from under their feet, be hurried down,</p>
<p>Down into the abyss, and the Sum-of-Things</p>
<p>Be following after, utterly fordone,</p>

<p rend="indent">  In chief, men marvel nature renders not</p>
<p>Bigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since</p>
<p>So vast the down-rush of the waters be,</p>
<p>And every river out of every realm</p>
<p>Cometh thereto; and add the random rains</p>
<p>And flying tempests, which spatter every sea</p>
<p>And every land bedew; add their own springs:</p>
<p>Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum</p>
<p>Shall be but as the increase of a drop.</p>
<p>Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea,</p>
<p>The mighty ocean, increaseth not. Besides,</p>
<p>Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part:</p>
<p>Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams</p>
<p>To dry our garments dripping all with wet;</p>
<p>And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath,</p>
<p>Do we behold. Therefore, however slight</p>
<p>The portion of wet that sun on any spot</p>
<p>Culls from the level main, he still will take</p>
<p>From off the waves in such a wide expanse</p>
<p>Abundantly. Then, further, also winds,</p>
<p>Sweeping the level waters, can bear off</p>
<p>A mighty part of wet, since we behold</p>
<p>Oft in a single night the highways dried</p>
<p>By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn.</p>
<p>Again, I've taught thee that the clouds bear off</p>
<p>Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches</p>
<p>Of the mighty main, and sprinkle it about</p>
<p>O'er all the zones, when rain is on the lands</p>
<p>And winds convey the aery racks of vapour.</p>
<p>Lastly, since earth is porous through her frame,</p>
<p>And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores,</p>
<p>The water's wet must seep into the lands</p>
<p>From briny ocean, as from lands it comes</p>
<p>Into the seas. For brine is filtered off,</p>
<p>And then the liquid stuff seeps back again</p>
<p>And all re-poureth at the river-heads,</p>
<p>Whence in fresh-water currents it returns</p>
<p>Over the lands, adown the channels which</p>
<p>Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along</p>
<p>The liquid-footed floods.</p>

<p>Such vast tornado-fires out-breathe at times,</p>
<p>I will unfold: for with no middling might</p>
<p>Of devastation the flamy tempest rose</p>
<p>And held dominion in Sicilian fields:</p>
<p>Drawing upon itself the upturned faces</p>
<p>Of neighbouring clans, what time they saw afar</p>
<p>The skiey vaults a-fume and sparkling all,</p>
<p>And filled their bosoms with dread anxiety</p>
<p>Of what new thing nature were travailing at.</p>
<p rend="indent">  In these affairs it much behooveth thee</p>
<p>To look both wide and deep, and far abroad</p>
<p>To peer to every quarter, that thou mayst</p>
<p>Remember how boundless is the Sum-of-Things,</p>
<p>And mark how infinitely small a part</p>
<p>Of the whole Sum is this one sky of ours-</p>
<p>O not so large a part as is one man</p>
<p>Of the whole earth. And plainly if thou viewest</p>
<p>This cosmic fact, placing it square in front,</p>
<p>And plainly understandest, thou wilt leave</p>
<p>Wondering at many things. For who of us</p>
<p>Wondereth if some one gets into his joints</p>
<p>A fever, gathering head with fiery heat,</p>
<p>Or any other dolorous disease</p>
<p>Along his members? For anon the foot</p>
<p>Grows blue and bulbous; often the sharp twinge</p>
<p>Seizes the teeth, attacks the very eyes;</p>
<p>Out-breaks the sacred fire, and, crawling on</p>
<p>Over the body, burneth every part</p>
<p>It seizeth on, and works its hideous way</p>
<p>Along the frame. No marvel this, since, lo,</p>
<p>Of things innumerable be seeds enough,</p>
<p>And this our earth and sky do bring to us</p>
<p>Enough of bane from whence can grow the strength</p>
<p>Of maladies uncounted. Thuswise, then,</p>
<p>We must suppose to all the sky and earth</p>
<p>Are ever supplied from out the infinite</p>
<p>All things, O all in stores enough whereby</p>
<p>The shaken earth can of a sudden move,</p>
<p>And fierce typhoons can over sea and lands</p>
<p>Go tearing on, and Aetna's fires o'erflow,</p>
<p>And heaven become a flame-burst. For that, too,</p>
<p>Happens at times, and the celestial vaults</p>
<p>Glow into fire, and rainy tempests rise</p>
<p>In heavier congregation, when, percase,</p>
<p>The seeds of water have foregathered thus</p>
<p>From out the infinite. "Aye, but passing huge</p>
<p>The fiery turmoil of that conflagration!"</p>
<p>So sayst thou; well, huge many a river seems</p>
<p>To him that erstwhile ne'er a larger saw;</p>
<p>Thus, huge seems tree or man; and everything</p>
<p>Which mortal sees the biggest of each class,</p>
<p>That he imagines to be "huge"; though yet</p>

<p>Out-blows abroad from vasty furnaces</p>
<p>Aetnaean. First, the mountain's nature is</p>
<p>All under-hollow, propped about, about</p>
<p>With caverns of basaltic piers. And, lo,</p>
<p>In all its grottos be there wind and air-</p>
<p>For wind is made when air hath been uproused</p>
<p>By violent agitation. When this air</p>
<p>Is heated through and through, and, raging round,</p>
<p>Hath made the earth and all the rocks it touches</p>
<p>Horribly hot, and hath struck off from them</p>
<p>Fierce fire of swiftest flame, it lifts itself</p>
<p>And hurtles thus straight upwards through its throat</p>
<p>Into high heav'n, and thus bears on afar</p>
<p>Its burning blasts and scattereth afar</p>
<p>Its ashes, and rolls a smoke of pitchy murk</p>
<p>And heaveth the while boulders of wondrous weight-</p>
<p>Leaving no doubt in thee that 'tis the air's</p>
<p>Tumultuous power. Besides, in mighty part,</p>
<p>The sea there at the roots of that same mount</p>
<p>Breaks its old billows and sucks back its surf.</p>
<p>And grottos from the sea pass in below</p>
<p>Even to the bottom of the mountain's throat.</p>
<p>Herethrough thou must admit there go...</p>

<p>And the conditions force [the water and air]</p>
<p>Deeply to penetrate from the open sea,</p>
<p>And to out-blow abroad, and to up-bear</p>
<p>Thereby the flame, and to up-cast from deeps</p>
<p>The boulders, and to rear the clouds of sand.</p>
<p>For at the top be "bowls," as people there</p>

<p>'Twere meet to name all causes of a death,</p>
<p>That cause of his death might thereby be named:</p>
<p>For prove thou mayst he perished not by steel,</p>
<p>By cold, nor even by poison nor disease,</p>
<p>Yet somewhat of this sort hath come to him</p>

<p>Unique in all the landscape, river sole</p>
<p>Of the Aegyptians. In mid-season heats</p>
<p>Often and oft he waters Aegypt o'er,</p>
<p>Either because in summer against his mouths</p>
<p>Come those northwinds which at that time of year</p>
<p>Men name the Etesian blasts, and, blowing thus</p>
<p>Upstream, retard, and, forcing back his waves,</p>
<p>Fill him o'erfull and force his flow to stop.</p>
<p>For out of doubt these blasts which driven be</p>
<p>From icy constellations of the pole</p>
<p>Are borne straight up the river. Comes that river</p>
<p>From forth the sultry places down the south,</p>
<p>Rising far up in midmost realm of day,</p>
<p>Among black generations of strong men</p>
<p>With sun-baked skins. 'Tis possible, besides,</p>
<p>That a big bulk of piled sand may bar</p>
<p>His mouths against his onward waves, when sea,</p>
<p>Wild in the winds, tumbles the sand to inland;</p>
<p>Whereby the river's outlet were less free,</p>
<p>Likewise less headlong his descending floods.</p>
<p>It may be, too, that in this season rains</p>
<p>Are more abundant at its fountain head,</p>
<p>Because the Etesian blasts of those northwinds</p>
<p>Then urge all clouds into those inland parts.</p>
<p>And, soothly, when they're thus foregathered there,</p>
<p>Urged yonder into midmost realm of day,</p>
<p>Then, crowded against the lofty mountain sides,</p>
<p>They're massed and powerfully pressed. Again,</p>
<p>Perchance, his waters wax, O far away,</p>

<p rend="indent">  Now come; and unto thee I will unfold,</p>
<p>As to the Birdless spots and Birdless tarns,</p>
<p>What sort of nature they are furnished with.</p>
<p>First, as to name of "birdless,"- that derives</p>
<p>From very fact, because they noxious be</p>
<p>Unto all birds. For when above those spots</p>
<p>In horizontal flight the birds have come,</p>
<p>Forgetting to oar with wings, they furl their sails,</p>
<p>And, with down-drooping of their delicate necks,</p>
<p>Fall headlong into earth, if haply such</p>
<p>The nature of the spots, or into water,</p>
<p>If haply spreads thereunder Birdless tarn.</p>
<p>Such spot's at <placeName key="tgn,7006931">Cumae</placeName>, where the mountains smoke,</p>
<p>Charged with the pungent sulphur, and increased</p>
<p>With steaming springs. And such a spot there is</p>
<p>Within the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, even there</p>
<p>On summit of Acropolis, beside</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,1123869">Fane</placeName> of Tritonian Pallas bountiful,</p>
<p>Where never cawing crows can wing their course,</p>
<p>Not even when smoke the altars with good gifts,-</p>
<p>But evermore they flee- yet not from wrath</p>
<p>Of Pallas, grieved at that espial old,</p>
<p>As poets of the Greeks have sung the tale;</p>
<p>But very nature of the place compels.</p>
<p>In <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> also- as men say- a spot</p>
<p>Is to be seen, where also four-foot kinds,</p>
<p>As soon as ever they've set their steps within,</p>
<p>Collapse, o'ercome by its essential power,</p>
<p>As if there slaughtered to the under-gods.</p>
<p>Lo, all these wonders work by natural law,</p>
<p>And from what causes they are brought to pass</p>
<p>The origin is manifest; so, haply,</p>
<p>Let none believe that in these regions stands</p>
<p>The gate of Orcus, nor us then suppose,</p>
<p>Haply, that thence the under-gods draw down</p>
<p>Souls to dark shores of Acheron- as stags,</p>
<p>The wing-footed, are thought to draw to light,</p>
<p>By sniffing nostrils, from their dusky lairs</p>
<p>The wriggling generations of wild snakes.</p>
<p>How far removed from true reason is this,</p>
<p>Perceive thou straight; for now I'll try to say</p>
<p>Somewhat about the very fact.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="769"/>
<p rend="indent">                                 And, first,</p>
<p>This do I say, as oft I've said before:</p>
<p>In earth are atoms of things of every sort;</p>
<p>And know, these all thus rise from out the earth-</p>
<p>Many life-giving which be good for food,</p>
<p>And many which can generate disease</p>
<p>And hasten death, O many primal seeds</p>
<p>Of many things in many modes- since earth</p>
<p>Contains them mingled and gives forth discrete.</p>
<p>And we have shown before that certain things</p>
<p>Be unto certain creatures suited more</p>
<p>For ends of life, by virtue of a nature,</p>
<p>A texture, and primordial shapes, unlike</p>
<p>For kinds alike. Then too 'tis thine to see</p>
<p>How many things oppressive be and foul</p>
<p>To man, and to sensation most malign:</p>
<p>Many meander miserably through ears;</p>
<p>Many in-wind athrough the nostrils too,</p>
<p>Malign and harsh when mortal draws a breath;</p>
<p>Of not a few must one avoid the touch;</p>
<p>Of not a few must one escape the sight;</p>
<p>And some there be all loathsome to the taste;</p>
<p>And many, besides, relax the languid limbs</p>
<p>Along the frame, and undermine the soul</p>
<p>In its abodes within. To certain trees</p>
<p>There hath been given so dolorous a shade</p>
<p>That often they gender achings of the head,</p>
<p>If one but be beneath, outstretched on the sward.</p>
<p>There is, again, on Helicon's high hills</p>
<p>A tree that's wont to kill a man outright</p>
<p>By fetid odour of its very flower.</p>
<p>And when the pungent stench of the night-lamp,</p>
<p>Extinguished but a moment since, assails</p>
<p>The nostrils, then and there it puts to sleep</p>
<p>A man afflicted with the falling sickness</p>
<p>And foamings at the mouth. A woman, too,</p>
<p>At the heavy castor drowses back in chair,</p>
<p>And from her delicate fingers slips away</p>
<p>Her gaudy handiwork, if haply she</p>
<p>Hath got the whiff at menstruation-time.</p>
<p>Once more, if thou delayest in hot baths,</p>
<p>When thou art over-full, how readily</p>
<p>From stool in middle of the steaming water</p>
<p>Thou tumblest in a fit! How readily</p>
<p>The heavy fumes of charcoal wind their way</p>
<p>Into the brain, unless beforehand we</p>
<p>Of water 've drunk. But when a burning fever,</p>
<p>O'ermastering man, hath seized upon his limbs,</p>
<p>Then odour of wine is like a hammer-blow.</p>
<p>And seest thou not how in the very earth</p>
<p>Sulphur is gendered and bitumen thickens</p>
<p>With noisome stench?- What direful stenches, too,</p>
<p>Scaptensula out-breathes from down below,</p>
<p>When men pursue the veins of silver and gold,</p>
<p>With pick-axe probing round the hidden realms</p>
<p>Deep in the earth?- Or what of deadly bane</p>
<p>The mines of gold exhale? O what a look,</p>
<p>And what a ghastly hue they give to men!</p>
<p>And seest thou not, or hearest, how they're wont</p>
<p>In little time to perish, and how fail</p>
<p>The life-stores in those folk whom mighty power</p>
<p>Of grim necessity confineth there</p>
<p>In such a task? Thus, this telluric earth</p>
<p>Out-streams with all these dread effluvia</p>
<p>And breathes them out into the open world</p>
<p>And into the visible regions under heaven.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="818"/>
<p rend="indent">  Thus, too, those Birdless places must up-send</p>
<p>An essence bearing death to winged things,</p>
<p>Which from the earth rises into the breezes</p>
<p>To poison part of skiey space, and when</p>
<p>Thither the winged is on pennons borne,</p>
<p>There, seized by the unseen poison, 'tis ensnared,</p>
<p>And from the horizontal of its flight</p>
<p>Drops to the spot whence sprang the effluvium.</p>
<p>And when 'thas there collapsed, then the same power</p>
<p>Of that effluvium takes from all its limbs</p>
<p>The relics of its life. That power first strikes</p>
<p>The creatures with a wildering dizziness,</p>
<p>And then thereafter, when they're once down-fallen</p>
<p>Into the poison's very fountains, then</p>
<p>Life, too, they vomit out perforce, because</p>
<p>So thick the stores of bane around them fume.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Again, at times it happens that this power,</p>
<p>This exhalation of the Birdless places,</p>
<p>Dispels the air betwixt the ground and birds,</p>
<p>Leaving well-nigh a void. And thither when</p>
<p>In horizontal flight the birds have come,</p>
<p>Forthwith their buoyancy of pennons limps,</p>
<p>All useless, and each effort of both wings</p>
<p>Falls out in vain. Here, when without all power</p>
<p>To buoy themselves and on their wings to lean,</p>
<p>Lo, nature constrains them by their weight to slip</p>
<p>Down to the earth, and lying prostrate there</p>
<p>Along the well-nigh empty void, they spend</p>
<p>Their souls through all the openings of their frame.</p>

<milestone unit="card" n="840"/>
<p rend="indent">  Further, the water of wells is colder then</p>
<p>At summer time, because the earth by heat</p>
<p>Is rarefied, and sends abroad in air</p>
<p>Whatever seeds it peradventure have</p>
<p>Of its own fiery exhalations.</p>
<p>The more, then, the telluric ground is drained</p>
<p>Of heat, the colder grows the water hid</p>
<p>Within the earth. Further, when all the earth</p>
<p>Is by the cold compressed, and thus contracts</p>
<p>And, so to say, concretes, it happens, lo,</p>
<p>That by contracting it expresses then</p>
<p>Into the wells what heat it bears itself.</p>
<p rend="indent">  'Tis said at Hammon's fane a fountain is,</p>
<p>In daylight cold and hot in time of night.</p>
<p>This fountain men be-wonder over-much,</p>
<p>And think that suddenly it seethes in heat</p>
<p>By intense sun, the subterranean, when</p>
<p>Night with her terrible murk hath cloaked the lands-</p>
<p>What's not true reasoning by a long remove:</p>
<p>I' faith when sun o'erhead, touching with beams</p>
<p>An open body of water, had no power</p>
<p>To render it hot upon its upper side,</p>
<p>Though his high light possess such burning glare,</p>
<p>How, then, can he, when under the gross earth,</p>
<p>Make water boil and glut with fiery heat?-</p>
<p>And, specially, since scarcely potent he</p>
<p>Through hedging walls of houses to inject</p>
<p>His exhalations hot, with ardent rays.</p>
<p>What, then's, the principle? Why, this, indeed:</p>
<p>The earth about that spring is porous more</p>
<p>Than elsewhere the telluric ground, and be</p>
<p>Many the seeds of fire hard by the water;</p>
<p>On this account, when night with dew-fraught shades</p>
<p>Hath whelmed the earth, anon the earth deep down</p>
<p>Grows chill, contracts; and thuswise squeezes out</p>
<p>Into the spring what seeds she holds of fire</p>
<p>(As one might squeeze with fist), which render hot</p>
<p>The touch and steam of the fluid. Next, when sun,</p>
<p>Up-risen, with his rays has split the soil</p>
<p>And rarefied the earth with waxing heat,</p>
<p>Again into their ancient abodes return</p>
<p>The seeds of fire, and all the Hot of water</p>
<p>Into the earth retires; and this is why</p>
<p>The fountain in the daylight gets so cold.</p>
<p>Besides, the water's wet is beat upon</p>
<p>By rays of sun, and, with the dawn, becomes</p>
<p>Rarer in texture under his pulsing blaze;</p>
<p>And, therefore, whatso seeds it holds of fire</p>
<p>It renders up, even as it renders oft</p>
<p>The frost that it contains within itself</p>
<p>And thaws its ice and looseneth the knots.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="879"/>
<p>There is, moreover, a fountain cold in kind</p>
<p>That makes a bit of tow (above it held)</p>
<p>Take fire forthwith and shoot a flame; so, too,</p>
<p>A pitch-pine torch will kindle and flare round</p>
<p>Along its waves, wherever 'tis impelled</p>
<p>Afloat before the breeze. No marvel, this:</p>
<p>Because full many seeds of heat there be</p>
<p>Within the water; and, from earth itself</p>
<p>Out of the deeps must particles of fire</p>
<p>Athrough the entire fountain surge aloft,</p>
<p>And speed in exhalations into air</p>
<p>Forth and abroad (yet not in numbers enow</p>
<p>As to make hot the fountain). And, moreo'er,</p>
<p>Some force constrains them, scattered through the water,</p>
<p>Forthwith to burst abroad, and to combine</p>
<p>In flame above. Even as a fountain far</p>
<p>There is at <placeName key="tgn,7016538">Aradus</placeName> amid the sea,</p>
<p>Which bubbles out sweet water and disparts</p>
<p>From round itself the salt waves; and, behold,</p>
<p>In many another region the broad main</p>
<p>Yields to the thirsty mariners timely help,</p>
<p>Belching sweet waters forth amid salt waves.</p>
<p>Just so, then, can those seeds of fire burst forth</p>
<p>Athrough that other fount, and bubble out</p>
<p>Abroad against the bit of tow; and when</p>
<p>They there collect or cleave unto the torch,</p>
<p>Forthwith they readily flash aflame, because</p>
<p>The tow and torches, also, in themselves</p>
<p>Have many seeds of latent fire. Indeed,</p>
<p>And seest thou not, when near the nightly lamps</p>
<p>Thou bringest a flaxen wick, extinguished</p>
<p>A moment since, it catches fire before</p>
<p>'Thas touched the flame, and in same wise a torch?</p>
<p>And many another object flashes aflame</p>
<p>When at a distance, touched by heat alone,</p>
<p>Before 'tis steeped in veritable fire.</p>
<p>This, then, we must suppose to come to pass</p>
<p>In that spring also.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="906"/>
<p rend="indent">                      Now to other things!</p>
<p>And I'll begin to treat by what decree</p>
<p>Of nature it came to pass that iron can be</p>
<p>By that stone drawn which Greeks the magnet call</p>
<p>After the country's name (its origin</p>
<p>Being in country of Magnesian folk).</p>
<p>This stone men marvel at; and sure it oft</p>
<p>Maketh a chain of rings, depending, lo,</p>
<p>From off itself! Nay, thou mayest see at times</p>
<p>Five or yet more in order dangling down</p>
<p>And swaying in the delicate winds, whilst one</p>
<p>Depends from other, cleaving to under-side,</p>
<p>And ilk one feels the stone's own power and bonds-</p>
<p>So over-masteringly its power flows down.</p>
<p rend="indent">  In things of this sort, much must be made sure</p>
<p>Ere thou account of the thing itself canst give,</p>
<p>And the approaches roundabout must be;</p>
<p>Wherefore the more do I exact of thee</p>
<p>A mind and ears attent.</p>
<p rend="indent">                         First, from all things</p>
<p>We see soever, evermore must flow,</p>
<p>Must be discharged and strewn about, about,</p>
<p>Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.</p>
<p>From certain things flow odours evermore,</p>
<p>As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray</p>
<p>From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls</p>
<p>Along the coasts. Nor ever cease to seep</p>
<p>The varied echoings athrough the air.</p>
<p>Then, too, there comes into the mouth at times</p>
<p>The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea</p>
<p>We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch</p>
<p>The wormwood being mixed, its bitter stings.</p>
<p>To such degree from all things is each thing</p>
<p>Borne streamingly along, and sent about</p>
<p>To every region round; and nature grants</p>
<p>Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,</p>
<p>Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,</p>
<p>And all the time are suffered to descry</p>
<p>And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="936"/>
<p rend="indent">  Now will I seek again to bring to mind</p>
<p>How porous a body all things have- a fact</p>
<p>Made manifest in my first canto, too.</p>
<p>For, truly, though to know this doth import</p>
<p>For many things, yet for this very thing</p>
<p>On which straightway I'm going to discourse,</p>
<p>'Tis needful most of all to make it sure</p>
<p>That naught's at hand but body mixed with void.</p>
<p>A first ensample: in grottos, rocks o'erhead</p>
<p>Sweat moisture and distil the oozy drops;</p>
<p>Likewise, from all our body seeps the sweat;</p>
<p>There grows the beard, and along our members all</p>
<p>And along our frame the hairs. Through all our veins</p>
<p>Disseminates the foods, and gives increase</p>
<p>And aliment down to the extreme parts,</p>
<p>Even to the tiniest finger-nails. Likewise,</p>
<p>Through solid bronze the cold and fiery heat</p>
<p>We feel to pass; likewise, we feel them pass</p>
<p>Through gold, through silver, when we clasp in hand</p>
<p>The brimming goblets. And, again, there flit</p>
<p>Voices through houses' hedging walls of stone;</p>
<p>Odour seeps through, and cold, and heat of fire</p>
<p>That's wont to penetrate even strength of iron.</p>
<p>Again, where corselet of the sky girds round</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>And at same time, some Influence of bane,</p>
<p>When from Beyond 'thas stolen into [our world].</p>
<p>And tempests, gathering from the earth and sky,</p>
<p>Back to the sky and earth absorbed retire-</p>
<p>With reason, since there's naught that's fashioned not</p>
<p>With body porous.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="959"/>
<p rend="indent">                   Furthermore, not all</p>
<p>The particles which be from things thrown off</p>
<p>Are furnished with same qualities for sense,</p>
<p>Nor be for all things equally adapt.</p>
<p>A first ensample: the sun doth bake and parch</p>
<p>The earth; but ice he thaws, and with his beams</p>
<p>Compels the lofty snows, up-reared white</p>
<p>Upon the lofty hills, to waste away;</p>
<p>Then, wax, if set beneath the heat of him,</p>
<p>Melts to a liquid. And the fire, likewise,</p>
<p>Will melt the copper and will fuse the gold,</p>
<p>But hides and flesh it shrivels up and shrinks.</p>
<p>The water hardens the iron just off the fire,</p>
<p>But hides and flesh (made hard by heat) it softens.</p>
<p>The oleaster-tree as much delights</p>
<p>The bearded she-goats, verily as though</p>
<p>'Twere nectar-steeped and shed ambrosia;</p>
<p>Than which is naught that burgeons into leaf</p>
<p>More bitter food for man. A hog draws back</p>
<p>For marjoram oil, and every unguent fears</p>
<p>Fierce poison these unto the bristled hogs,</p>
<p>Yet unto us from time to time they seem,</p>
<p>As 'twere, to give new life. But, contrariwise,</p>
<p>Though unto us the mire be filth most foul,</p>
<p>To hogs that mire doth so delightsome seem</p>
<p>That they with wallowing from belly to back</p>
<p>Are never cloyed.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="979"/>
<p rend="indent">                   A point remains, besides,</p>
<p>Which best it seems to tell of, ere I go</p>
<p>To telling of the fact at hand itself.</p>
<p>Since to the varied things assigned be</p>
<p>The many pores, those pores must be diverse</p>
<p>In nature one from other, and each have</p>
<p>Its very shape, its own direction fixed.</p>
<p>And so, indeed, in breathing creatures be</p>
<p>The several senses, of which each takes in</p>
<p>Unto itself, in its own fashion ever,</p>
<p>Its own peculiar object. For we mark</p>
<p>How sounds do into one place penetrate,</p>
<p>Into another flavours of all juice,</p>
<p>And savour of smell into a third. Moreover,</p>
<p>One sort through rocks we see to seep, and, lo,</p>
<p>One sort to pass through wood, another still</p>
<p>Through gold, and others to go out and off</p>
<p>Through silver and through glass. For we do see</p>
<p>Through some pores form-and-look of things to flow,</p>
<p>Through others heat to go, and some things still</p>
<p>To speedier pass than others through same pores.</p>
<p>Of verity, the nature of these same paths,</p>
<p>Varying in many modes (as aforesaid)</p>
<p>Because of unlike nature and warp and woof</p>
<p>Of cosmic things, constrains it so to be.</p>
<p rend="indent">  Wherefore, since all these matters now have been</p>
<p>Established and settled well for us</p>
<p>As premises prepared, for what remains</p>
<p>'Twill not be hard to render clear account</p>
<p>By means of these, and the whole cause reveal</p>
<p>Whereby the magnet lures the strength of iron.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1002"/>
<p>First, stream there must from off the lode-stone seeds</p>
<p>Innumerable, a very tide, which smites</p>
<p>By blows that air asunder lying betwixt</p>
<p>The stone and iron. And when is emptied out</p>
<p>This space, and a large place between the two</p>
<p>Is made a void, forthwith the primal germs</p>
<p>Of iron, headlong slipping, fall conjoined</p>
<p>Into the vacuum, and the ring itself</p>
<p>By reason thereof doth follow after and go</p>
<p>Thuswise with all its body. And naught there is</p>
<p>That of its own primordial elements</p>
<p>More thoroughly knit or tighter linked coheres</p>
<p>Than nature and cold roughness of stout iron.</p>
<p>Wherefore, 'tis less a marvel what I said,</p>
<p>That from such elements no bodies can</p>
<p>From out the iron collect in larger throng</p>
<p>And be into the vacuum borne along,</p>
<p>Without the ring itself do follow after.</p>
<p>And this it does, and followeth on until</p>
<p>'Thath reached the stone itself and cleaved to it</p>
<p>By links invisible. Moreover, likewise,</p>
<p>The motion's assisted by a thing of aid</p>
<p>(Whereby the process easier becomes),-</p>
<p>Namely, by this: as soon as rarer grows</p>
<p>That air in front of the ring, and space between</p>
<p>Is emptied more and made a void, forthwith</p>
<p>It happens all the air that lies behind</p>
<p>Conveys it onward, pushing from the rear.</p>
<p>For ever doth the circumambient air</p>
<p>Drub things unmoved, but here it pushes forth</p>
<p>The iron, because upon one side the space</p>
<p>Lies void and thus receives the iron in.</p>
<p>This air, whereof I am reminding thee,</p>
<p>Winding athrough the iron's abundant pores</p>
<p>So subtly into the tiny parts thereof,</p>
<p>Shoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails.</p>
<p>The same doth happen in all directions forth:</p>
<p>From whatso side a space is made a void,</p>
<p>Whether from crosswise or above, forthwith</p>
<p>The neighbour particles are borne along</p>
<p>Into the vacuum; for of verity,</p>
<p>They're set a-going by poundings from elsewhere,</p>
<p>Nor by themselves of own accord can they</p>
<p>Rise upwards into the air. Again, all things</p>
<p>Must in their framework hold some air, because</p>
<p>They are of framework porous, and the air</p>
<p>Encompasses and borders on all things.</p>
<p>Thus, then, this air in iron so deeply stored</p>
<p>Is tossed evermore in vexed motion,</p>
<p>And therefore drubs upon the ring sans doubt</p>
<p>And shakes it up inside....</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>In sooth, that ring is thither borne along</p>
<p>To where 'thas once plunged headlong- thither, lo,</p>
<p>Unto the void whereto it took its start.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1042"/>
<p rend="indent">  It happens, too, at times that nature of iron</p>
<p>Shrinks from this stone away, accustomed</p>
<p>By turns to flee and follow. Yea, I've seen</p>
<p>Those Samothracian iron rings leap up,</p>
<p>And iron filings in the brazen bowls</p>
<p>Seethe furiously, when underneath was set</p>
<p>The magnet stone. So strongly iron seems</p>
<p>To crave to flee that rock. Such discord great</p>
<p>Is gendered by the interposed brass,</p>
<p>Because, forsooth, when first the tide of brass</p>
<p>Hath seized upon and held possession of</p>
<p>The iron's open passage-ways, thereafter</p>
<p>Cometh the tide of the stone, and in that iron</p>
<p>Findeth all spaces full, nor now hath holes</p>
<p>To swim through, as before. 'Tis thus constrained</p>
<p>With its own current 'gainst the iron's fabric</p>
<p>To dash and beat; by means whereof it spues</p>
<p>Forth from itself- and through the brass stirs up-</p>
<p>The things which otherwise without the brass</p>
<p>It sucks into itself. In these affairs</p>
<p>Marvel thou not that from this stone the tide</p>
<p>Prevails not likewise other things to move</p>
<p>With its own blows: for some stand firm by weight,</p>
<p>As gold; and some cannot be moved forever,</p>
<p>Because so porous in their framework they</p>
<p>That there the tide streams through without a break,</p>
<p>Of which sort stuff of wood is seen to be.</p>
<p>Therefore, when iron (which lies between the two)</p>
<p>Hath taken in some atoms of the brass,</p>
<p>Then do the streams of that Magnesian rock</p>
<p>Move iron by their smitings.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1065"/>
<p rend="indent">                              Yet these things</p>
<p>Are not so alien from others, that I</p>
<p>Of this same sort am ill prepared to name</p>
<p>Ensamples still of things exclusively</p>
<p>To one another adapt. Thou seest, first,</p>
<p>How lime alone cementeth stones: how wood</p>
<p>Only by glue-of-bull with wood is joined-</p>
<p>So firmly too that oftener the boards</p>
<p>Crack open along the weakness of the grain</p>
<p>Ere ever those taurine bonds will lax their hold.</p>
<p>The vine-born juices with the water-springs</p>
<p>Are bold to mix, though not the heavy pitch</p>
<p>With the light oil-of-olive. And purple dye</p>
<p>Of shell-fish so uniteth with the wool's</p>
<p>Body alone that it cannot be ta'en</p>
<p>Away forever- nay, though thou gavest toil</p>
<p>To restore the same with the Neptunian flood,</p>
<p>Nay, though all ocean willed to wash it out</p>
<p>With all its waves. Again, gold unto gold</p>
<p>Doth not one substance bind, and only one?</p>
<p>And is not brass by tin joined unto brass?</p>
<p>And other ensamples how many might one find!</p>
<p>What then? Nor is there unto thee a need</p>
<p>Of such long ways and roundabout, nor boots it</p>
<p>For me much toil on this to spend. More fit</p>
<p>It is in few words briefly to embrace</p>
<p>Things many: things whose textures fall together</p>
<p>So mutually adapt, that cavities</p>
<p>To solids correspond, these cavities</p>
<p>Of this thing to the solid parts of that,</p>
<p>And those of that to solid parts of this-</p>
<p>Such joinings are the best. Again, some things</p>
<p>Can be the one with other coupled and held,</p>
<p>Linked by hooks and eyes, as 'twere; and this</p>
<p>Seems more the fact with iron and this stone.</p>

<p>Now, of diseases what the law, and whence</p>
<p>The Influence of bane upgathering can</p>
<p>Upon the race of man and herds of cattle</p>

<p>I will unfold. And, first, I've taught above</p>

<p>Or from Beyond down through our atmosphere,</p>
<p>Like clouds and mists, descends, or else collects</p>
<p>From earth herself and rises, when, a-soak</p>
<p>And beat by rains unseasonable and suns,</p>
<p>Our earth hath then contracted stench and rot.</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> thou not, also, that whoso arrive</p>
<p>In region far from fatherland and home</p>
<p>Are by the strangeness of the clime and waters</p>
<p>Distempered?- since conditions vary much.</p>
<p>For in what else may we suppose the clime</p>
<p>Among the Britons to differ from Aegypt's own</p>
<p>(Where totters awry the axis of the world),</p>
<p>Or in what else to differ Pontic clime</p>
<p>From <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>' and from climes adown the south,</p>
<p>On to black generations of strong men</p>
<p>With sun-baked skins? Even as we thus do see</p>
<p>Four climes diverse under the four main-winds</p>
<p>And under the four main-regions of the sky,</p>
<p>So, too, are seen the colour and face of men</p>
<p>Vastly to disagree, and fixed diseases</p>
<p>To seize the generations, kind by kind:</p>
<p>There is the elephant-disease which down</p>
<p>In midmost Aegypt, hard by streams of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>,</p>
<p>Engendered is- and never otherwhere.</p>
<p>In <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> the feet are oft attacked,</p>
<p>And in Achaean lands the eyes. And so</p>
<p>The divers spots to divers parts and limbs</p>
<p>Are noxious; 'tis a variable air</p>
<p>That causes this. Thus when an atmosphere,</p>
<p>Alien by chance to us, begins to heave,</p>
<p>And noxious airs begin to crawl along,</p>
<p>They creep and wind like unto mist and cloud,</p>
<p>Slowly, and everything upon their way</p>
<p>They disarrange and force to change its state.</p>
<p>It happens, too, that when they've come at last</p>
<p>Into this atmosphere of ours, they taint</p>
<p>And make it like themselves and alien.</p>
<p>Therefore, asudden this devastation strange,</p>
<p>This pestilence, upon the waters falls,</p>
<p>Or settles on the very crops of grain</p>
<p>Or other meat of men and feed of flocks.</p>
<p>Or it remains a subtle force, suspense</p>
<p>In the atmosphere itself; and when therefrom</p>
<p>We draw our inhalations of mixed air,</p>
<p>Into our body equally its bane</p>
<p>Also we must suck in. In manner like,</p>
<p>Oft comes the pestilence upon the kine,</p>
<p>And sickness, too, upon the sluggish sheep.</p>
<p>Nor aught it matters whether journey we</p>
<p>To regions adverse to ourselves and change</p>
<p>The atmospheric cloak, or whether nature</p>
<p>Herself import a tainted atmosphere</p>
<p>To us or something strange to our own use</p>
<p>Which can attack us soon as ever it come.</p>

<p rend="indent">  'Twas such a manner of disease, 'twas such</p>
<p>Mortal miasma in Cecropian lands</p>
<p>Whilom reduced the plains to dead men's bones,</p>
<p>Unpeopled the highways, drained of citizens</p>
<p>The Athenian town. For coming from afar,</p>
<p>Rising in lands of Aegypt, traversing</p>
<p>Reaches of air and floating fields of foam,</p>
<p>At last on all Pandion's folk it swooped;</p>
<p>Whereat by troops unto disease and death</p>
<p>Were they o'er-given. At first, they'd bear about</p>
<p>A skull on fire with heat, and eyeballs twain</p>
<p>Red with suffusion of blank glare. Their throats,</p>
<p>Black on the inside, sweated oozy blood;</p>
<p>And the walled pathway of the voice of man</p>
<p>Was clogged with ulcers; and the very tongue,</p>
<p>The mind's interpreter, would trickle gore,</p>
<p>Weakened by torments, tardy, rough to touch.</p>
<p>Next when that Influence of bane had chocked,</p>
<p>Down through the throat, the breast, and streamed had</p>
<p>E'en into sullen heart of those sick folk,</p>
<p>Then, verily, all the fences of man's life</p>
<p>Began to topple. From the mouth the breath</p>
<p>Would roll a noisome stink, as stink to heaven</p>
<p>Rotting cadavers flung unburied out.</p>
<p>And, lo, thereafter, all the body's strength</p>
<p>And every power of mind would languish, now</p>
<p>In very doorway of destruction.</p>
<p>And anxious anguish and ululation (mixed</p>
<p>With many a groan) companioned alway</p>
<p>The intolerable torments. Night and day,</p>
<p>Recurrent spasms of vomiting would rack</p>
<p>Alway their thews and members, breaking down</p>
<p>With sheer exhaustion men already spent.</p>
<p>And yet on no one's body couldst thou mark</p>
<p>The skin with o'er-much heat to burn aglow,</p>
<p>But rather the body unto touch of hands</p>
<p>Would offer a warmish feeling, and thereby</p>
<p>Show red all over, with ulcers, so to say,</p>
<p>Inbranded, like the "sacred fires" o'erspread</p>
<p>Along the members. The inward parts of men,</p>
<p>In truth, would blaze unto the very bones;</p>
<p>A flame, like flame in furnaces, would blaze</p>
<p>Within the stomach. Nor couldst aught apply</p>
<p>Unto their members light enough and thin</p>
<p>For shift of aid- but coolness and a breeze</p>
<p>Ever and ever. Some would plunge those limbs</p>
<p>On fire with bane into the icy streams,</p>
<p>Hurling the body naked into the waves;</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1174"/>
<p>Many would headlong fling them deeply down</p>
<p>The water-pits, tumbling with eager mouth</p>
<p>Already agape. The insatiable thirst</p>
<p>That whelmed their parched bodies, lo, would make</p>
<p>A goodly shower seem like to scanty drops.</p>
<p>Respite of torment was there none. Their frames</p>
<p>Forspent lay prone. With silent lips of fear</p>
<p>Would Medicine mumble low, the while she saw</p>
<p>So many a time men roll their eyeballs round,</p>
<p>Staring wide-open, unvisited of sleep,</p>
<p>The heralds of old death. And in those months</p>
<p>Was given many another sign of death:</p>
<p>The intellect of mind by sorrow and dread</p>
<p>Deranged, the sad brow, the countenance</p>
<p>Fierce and delirious, the tormented ears</p>
<p>Beset with ringings, the breath quick and short</p>
<p>Or huge and intermittent, soaking sweat</p>
<p>A-glisten on neck, the spittle in fine gouts</p>
<p>Tainted with colour of crocus and so salt,</p>
<p>The cough scarce wheezing through the rattling throat.</p>
<p>Aye, and the sinews in the fingered hands</p>
<p>Were sure to contract, and sure the jointed frame</p>
<p>To shiver, and up from feet the cold to mount</p>
<p>Inch after inch: and toward the supreme hour</p>
<p>At last the pinched nostrils, nose's tip</p>
<p>A very point, eyes sunken, temples hollow,</p>
<p>Skin cold and hard, the shuddering grimace,</p>
<p>The pulled and puffy flesh above the brows!-</p>
<p>O not long after would their frames lie prone</p>
<p>In rigid death. And by about the eighth</p>
<p>Resplendent light of sun, or at the most</p>
<p>On the ninth flaming of his flambeau, they</p>
<p>Would render up the life. If any then</p>
<p>Had 'scaped the doom of that destruction, yet</p>
<p>Him there awaited in the after days</p>
<p>A wasting and a death from ulcers vile</p>
<p>And black discharges of the belly, or else</p>
<p>Through the clogged nostrils would there ooze along</p>
<p>Much fouled blood, oft with an aching head:</p>
<p>Hither would stream a man's whole strength and flesh.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1205"/>
<p>And whoso had survived that virulent flow</p>
<p>Of the vile blood, yet into thews of him</p>
<p>And into his joints and very genitals</p>
<p>Would pass the old disease. And some there were,</p>
<p>Dreading the doorways of destruction</p>
<p>So much, lived on, deprived by the knife</p>
<p>Of the male member; not a few, though lopped</p>
<p>Of hands and feet, would yet persist in life,</p>
<p>And some there were who lost their eyeballs: O</p>
<p>So fierce a fear of death had fallen on them!</p>
<p>And some, besides, were by oblivion</p>
<p>Of all things seized, that even themselves they knew</p>
<p>No longer. And though corpse on corpse lay piled</p>
<p>Unburied on ground, the race of birds and beasts</p>
<p>Would or spring back, scurrying to escape</p>
<p>The virulent stench, or, if they'd tasted there,</p>
<p>Would languish in approaching death. But yet</p>
<p>Hardly at all during those many suns</p>
<p>Appeared a fowl, nor from the woods went forth</p>
<p>The sullen generations of wild beasts-</p>
<p>They languished with disease and died and died.</p>
<p>In chief, the faithful dogs, in all the streets</p>
<p>Outstretched, would yield their breath distressfully</p>
<p>For so that Influence of bane would twist</p>
<p>Life from their members. Nor was found one sure</p>
<p>And universal principle of cure:</p>
<p>For what to one had given the power to take</p>
<p>The vital winds of air into his mouth,</p>
<p>And to gaze upward at the vaults of sky,</p>
<p>The same to others was their death and doom.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1230"/>
<p rend="indent">  In those affairs, O awfullest of all,</p>
<p>O pitiable most was this, was this:</p>
<p>Whoso once saw himself in that disease</p>
<p>Entangled, ay, as damned unto death,</p>
<p>Would lie in wanhope, with a sullen heart,</p>
<p>Would, in fore-vision of his funeral,</p>
<p>Give up the ghost, O then and there. For, lo,</p>
<p>At no time did they cease one from another</p>
<p>To catch contagion of the greedy plague,-</p>
<p>As though but woolly flocks and horned herds;</p>
<p>And this in chief would heap the dead on dead:</p>
<p>For who forbore to look to their own sick,</p>
<p>O these (too eager of life, of death afeard)</p>
<p>Would then, soon after, slaughtering Neglect</p>
<p>Visit with vengeance of evil death and base-</p>
<p>Themselves deserted and forlorn of help.</p>
<p>But who had stayed at hand would perish there</p>
<p>By that contagion and the toil which then</p>
<p>A sense of honour and the pleading voice</p>
<p>Of weary watchers, mixed with voice of wail</p>
<p>Of dying folk, forced them to undergo.</p>
<p>This kind of death each nobler soul would meet.</p>
<p>The funerals, uncompanioned, forsaken,</p>
<p>Like rivals contended to be hurried through.</p>
<p rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</p>
<p>And men contending to ensepulchre</p>
<p>Pile upon pile the throng of their own dead:</p>
<p>And weary with woe and weeping wandered home;</p>
<p>And then the most would take to bed from grief.</p>
<p>Nor could be found not one, whom nor disease</p>
<p>Nor death, nor woe had not in those dread times</p>
<p>Attacked.</p>
<milestone unit="card" n="1247"/>
<p rend="indent">  By now the shepherds and neatherds all,</p>
<p>Yea, even the sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,</p>
<p>Began to sicken, and their bodies would lie</p>
<p>Huddled within back-corners of their huts,</p>
<p>Delivered by squalor and disease to death.</p>
<p>O often and often couldst thou then have seen</p>
<p>On lifeless children lifeless parents prone,</p>
<p>Or offspring on their fathers', mothers' corpse</p>
<p>Yielding the life. And into the city poured</p>
<p>O not in least part from the countryside</p>
<p>That tribulation, which the peasantry</p>
<p>Sick, sick, brought thither, thronging from every quarter,</p>
<p>Plague-stricken mob. All places would they crowd,</p>
<p>All buildings too; whereby the more would death</p>
<p>Up-pile a-heap the folk so crammed in town.</p>
<p>Ah, many a body thirst had dragged and rolled</p>
<p>Along the highways there was lying strewn</p>
<p>Besides Silenus-headed water-fountains,-</p>
<p>The life-breath choked from that too dear desire</p>
<p>Of pleasant waters. Ah, everywhere along</p>
<p>The open places of the populace,</p>
<p>And along the highways, O thou mightest see</p>
<p>Of many a half-dead body the sagged limbs,</p>
<p>Rough with squalor, wrapped around with rags,</p>
<p>Perish from very nastiness, with naught</p>
<p>But skin upon the bones, well-nigh already</p>
<p>Buried- in ulcers vile and obscene filth.</p>
<p>All holy temples, too, of deities</p>
<p>Had Death becrammed with the carcasses;</p>
<p>And stood each fane of the Celestial Ones</p>
<p>Laden with stark cadavers everywhere-</p>
<p>Places which warders of the shrines had crowded</p>
<p>With many a guest. For now no longer men</p>
<p>Did mightily esteem the old Divine,</p>
<p>The worship of the gods: the woe at hand</p>
<p>Did over-master. Nor in the city then</p>
<p>Remained those rites of sepulture, with which</p>
<p>That pious folk had evermore been wont</p>
<p>To buried be. For it was wildered all</p>
<p>In wild alarms, and each and every one</p>
<p>With sullen sorrow would bury his own dead,</p>
<p>As present shift allowed. And sudden stress</p>
<p>And poverty to many an awful act</p>
<p>Impelled; and with a monstrous screaming they</p>
<p>Would, on the frames of alien funeral pyres,</p>
<p>Place their own kin, and thrust the torch beneath</p>
<p>Oft brawling with much bloodshed round about</p>
<p>Rather than quit dead bodies loved in life.</p>
