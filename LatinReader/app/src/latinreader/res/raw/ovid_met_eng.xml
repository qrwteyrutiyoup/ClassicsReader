<p n="tr">Before the ocean and the earth appeared</p>
<p n="tr">before the skies had overspread them all</p>
<p n="tr">the face of Nature in a vast expanse</p>
<p n="tr">was naught but Chaos uniformly waste.</p>
<p n="tr">It was a rude and undeveloped mass,</p>
<p n="tr">that nothing made except a ponderous weight;</p>
<p n="tr">and all discordant elements confused,</p>
<p n="tr">were there congested in a shapeless heap.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">As yet the sun afforded earth no light,</p>
<p n="tr">nor did the moon renew her crescent horns;</p>
<p n="tr">the earth was not suspended in the air</p>
<p n="tr">exactly balanced by her heavy weight.</p>
<p n="tr">Not far along the margin of the shores</p>
<p n="tr">had Amphitrite stretched her lengthened arms,</p>
<p n="tr">for all the land was mixed with sea and air.</p>
<p n="tr">The land was soft, the sea unfit to sail,</p>
<p n="tr">the atmosphere opaque, to naught was given</p>
<p n="tr">a proper form, in everything was strife,</p>
<p n="tr">and all was mingled in a seething mass</p>
<p n="tr">with hot the cold parts strove, and wet with dry</p>
<p n="tr">and soft with hard, and weight with empty void.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">But God, or kindly Nature, ended strife</p>
<p n="tr">he cut the land from skies, the sea from land,</p>
<p n="tr">the heavens ethereal from material air;</p>
<p n="tr">and when were all evolved from that dark mass</p>
<p n="tr">he bound the fractious parts in tranquil peace.</p>
<p n="tr">The fiery element of convex heaven</p>
<p n="tr">leaped from the mass devoid of dragging weight,</p>
<p n="tr">and chose the summit arch to which the air</p>
<p n="tr">as next in quality was next in place.</p>
<p n="tr">The earth more dense attracted grosser parts</p>
<p n="tr">and moved by gravity sank underneath;</p>
<p n="tr">and last of all the wide surrounding waves</p>
<p n="tr">in deeper channels rolled around the globe.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">And when this God which one is yet unknown</p>
<p n="tr">had carved asunder that discordant mass,</p>
<p n="tr">had thus reduced it to its elements,</p>
<p n="tr">that every part should equally combine,</p>
<p n="tr">when time began He rounded out the earth</p>
<p n="tr">and moulded it to form a mighty globe.</p>
<p n="tr">Then poured He forth the deeps and gave command</p>
<p n="tr">that they should billow in the rapid winds,</p>
<p n="tr">that they should compass every shore of earth. </p>
<p n="tr">he also added fountains, pools and lakes,</p>
<p n="tr">and bound with shelving banks the slanting streams,</p>
<p n="tr">which partly are absorbed and partly join</p>
<p n="tr">the boundless ocean. Thus received amid</p>
<p n="tr">the wide expanse of uncontrolled waves,</p>
<p n="tr">they beat the shores instead of crooked banks.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">At His command the boundless plains extend,</p>
<p n="tr">the valleys are depressed, the woods are clothed</p>
<p n="tr">in green, the stony mountains rise. And as</p>
<p n="tr">the heavens are intersected on the right</p>
<p n="tr">by two broad zones, by two that cut the left,</p>
<p n="tr">and by a fifth consumed with ardent heat,</p>
<p n="tr">with such a number did the careful God</p>
<p n="tr">mark off the compassed weight, and thus the earth</p>
<p n="tr">received as many climes.Such heat consumes</p>
<p n="tr">the middle zone that none may dwell therein;</p>
<p n="tr">and two extremes are covered with deep snow;</p>
<p n="tr">and two are placed betwixt the hot and cold,</p>
<p n="tr">which mixed together give a temperate clime;</p>
<p n="tr">and over all the atmosphere suspends</p>
<p n="tr">with weight proportioned to the fiery sky,</p>
<p n="tr">exactly as the weight of earth compares</p>
<p n="tr">with weight of water.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">And He ordered mist</p>
<p n="tr">to gather in the air and spread the clouds.</p>
<p n="tr">He fixed the thunders that disturb our souls,</p>
<p n="tr">and brought the lightning on destructive winds</p>
<p n="tr">that also waft the cold. Nor did the great</p>
<p n="tr">Artificer permit these mighty winds</p>
<p n="tr">to blow unbounded in the pathless skies,</p>
<p n="tr">but each discordant brother fixed in space,</p>
<p n="tr">although His power can scarce restrain their rage</p>
<p n="tr">to rend the universe. At His command</p>
<p n="tr">to far Aurora, Eurus took his way,</p>
<p n="tr">to Nabath, <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, and that mountain range</p>
<p n="tr">first gilded by the dawn; and Zephyr's flight</p>
<p n="tr">was towards the evening star and peaceful shores,</p>
<p n="tr">warm with the setting sun; and Boreas</p>
<p n="tr">invaded <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName> and the northern snows;</p>
<p n="tr">and Auster wafted to the distant south</p>
<p n="tr">where clouds and rain encompass his abode.</p>
<p n="tr">and over these He fixed the liquid sky,</p>
<p n="tr">devoid of weight and free from earthly dross.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">And scarcely had He separated these</p>
<p n="tr">and fixed their certain bounds, when all the stars,</p>
<p n="tr">which long were pressed and hidden in the mass,</p>
<p n="tr">began to gleam out from the plains of heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">and traversed, with the Gods, bright ether fields:</p>
<p n="tr">and lest some part might be bereft of life</p>
<p n="tr">the gleaming waves were filled with twinkling fish;</p>
<p n="tr">the earth was covered with wild animals;</p>
<p n="tr">the agitated air was filled with birds. </p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">But one more perfect and more sanctified,</p>
<p n="tr">a being capable of lofty thought,</p>
<p n="tr">intelligent to rule, was wanting still</p>
<p n="tr">man was created! Did the Unknown God</p>
<p n="tr">designing then a better world make man</p>
<p n="tr">of seed divine? or did Prometheus</p>
<p n="tr">take the new soil of earth (that still contained</p>
<p n="tr">some godly element of Heaven's Life)</p>
<p n="tr">and use it to create the race of man;</p>
<p n="tr">first mingling it with water of new streams;</p>
<p n="tr">so that his new creation, upright man,</p>
<p n="tr">was made in image of commanding Gods?</p>
<p n="tr">On earth the brute creation bends its gaze,</p>
<p n="tr">but man was given a lofty countenance</p>
<p n="tr">and was commanded to behold the skies;</p>
<p n="tr">and with an upright face may view the stars:</p>
<p n="tr">and so it was that shapeless clay put on</p>
<p n="tr">the form of man till then unknown to earth.</p>

<p n="tr">First was the Golden Age. Then rectitude</p>
<p n="tr">spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith.</p>
<p n="tr">Avengers were not seen, for laws unframed</p>
<p n="tr">were all unknown and needless. Punishment</p>
<p n="tr">and fear of penalties existed not.</p>
<p n="tr">No harsh decrees were fixed on brazen plates.</p>
<p n="tr">No suppliant multitude the countenance</p>
<p n="tr">of Justice feared, averting, for they dwelt</p>
<p n="tr">without a judge in peace. Descended not</p>
<p n="tr">the steeps, shorn from its height, the lofty pine,</p>
<p n="tr">cleaving the trackless waves of alien shores,</p>
<p n="tr">nor distant realms were known to wandering men.</p>
<p n="tr">The towns were not entrenched for time of war;</p>
<p n="tr">they had no brazen trumpets, straight, nor horns</p>
<p n="tr">of curving brass, nor helmets, shields nor swords.</p>
<p n="tr">There was no thought of martial pomp secure</p>
<p n="tr">a happy multitude enjoyed repose.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">Then of her own accord the earth produced</p>
<p n="tr">a store of every fruit. The harrow touched</p>
<p n="tr">her not, nor did the plowshare wound</p>
<p n="tr">her fields. And man content with given food,</p>
<p n="tr">and none compelling, gathered arbute fruits</p>
<p n="tr">and wild strawberries on the mountain sides,</p>
<p n="tr">and ripe blackberries clinging to the bush,</p>
<p n="tr">and corners and sweet acorns on the ground,</p>
<p n="tr">down fallen from the spreading tree of Jove.</p>
<p n="tr">Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed</p>
<p n="tr">and warmly cherished buds and blooms, produced</p>
<p n="tr">without a seed. The valleys though unplowed</p>
<p n="tr">gave many fruits; the fields though not renewed</p>
<p n="tr">white glistened with the heavy bearded wheat:</p>
<p n="tr">rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees,</p>
<p n="tr">the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">When Saturn had been banished into night</p>
<p n="tr">and all the world was ruled by Jove supreme,</p>
<p n="tr">the Silver Age, though not so good as gold</p>
<p n="tr">but still surpassing yellow brass, prevailed.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">Jove first reduced to years the Primal Spring,</p>
<p n="tr">by him divided into periods four,</p>
<p n="tr">unequal,summer, autumn, winter, spring.</p>
<p n="tr">then glowed with tawny heat the parched air,</p>
<p n="tr">or pendent icicles in winter froze</p>
<p n="tr">and man stopped crouching in crude caverns, while</p>
<p n="tr">he built his homes of tree rods, bark entwined.</p>
<p n="tr">Then were the cereals planted in long rows,</p>
<p n="tr">and bullocks groaned beneath the heavy yoke.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">The third Age followed, called The Age of Bronze,</p>
<p n="tr">when cruel people were inclined to arms</p>
<p n="tr">but not to impious crimes. And last of all</p>
<p n="tr">the ruthless and hard Age of Iron prevailed,</p>
<p n="tr">from which malignant vein great evil sprung;</p>
<p n="tr">and modesty and faith and truth took flight,</p>
<p n="tr">and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds</p>
<p n="tr">and violence and wicked love of gain,</p>
<p n="tr">succeeded.Then the sailor spread his sails</p>
<p n="tr">to winds unknown, and keels that long had stood</p>
<p n="tr">on lofty mountains pierced uncharted waves.</p>
<p n="tr">Surveyors anxious marked with metes and bounds</p>
<p n="tr">the lands, created free as light and air:</p>
<p n="tr">nor need the rich ground furnish only crops,</p>
<p n="tr">and give due nourishment by right required,</p>
<p n="tr">they penetrated to the bowels of earth</p>
<p n="tr">and dug up wealth, bad cause of all our ills,</p>
<p n="tr">rich ores which long ago the earth had hid</p>
<p n="tr">and deep removed to gloomy Stygian caves:</p>
<p n="tr">and soon destructive iron and harmful gold</p>
<p n="tr">were brought to light; and War, which uses both,</p>
<p n="tr">came forth and shook with sanguinary grip</p>
<p n="tr">his clashing arms. Rapacity broke forth</p>
<p n="tr">the guest was not protected from his host,</p>
<p n="tr">the father in law from his own son in law;</p>
<p n="tr">even brothers seldom could abide in peace.</p>
<p n="tr">The husband threatened to destroy his wife,</p>
<p n="tr">and she her husband: horrid step dames mixed</p>
<p n="tr">the deadly henbane: eager sons inquired</p>
<p n="tr">their fathers, ages. Piety was slain:</p>
<p n="tr">and last of all the virgin deity,</p>
<p n="tr">Astraea vanished from the blood-stained earth.</p>

<milestone ed="More" n="GIANTS" unit="tale"/>
<p n="tr">And lest ethereal heights should long remain</p>
<p n="tr">less troubled than the earth, the throne of Heaven</p>
<p n="tr">was threatened by the Giants;   and they piled</p>
<p n="tr">mountain on mountain to the lofty stars.</p>
<p n="tr">But Jove, omnipotent, shot thunderbolts</p>
<p n="tr">through <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Mount Olympus</placeName>, and he overturned</p>
<p n="tr">from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion.</p>
<p n="tr">And while these dreadful bodies lay overwhelmed</p>
<p n="tr">in their tremendous bulk, (so fame reports)</p>
<p n="tr">the Earth was reeking with the copious blood</p>
<p n="tr">of her gigantic sons; and thus replete</p>
<p n="tr">with moisture she infused the steaming gore</p>
<p n="tr">with life renewed. So that a monument</p>
<p n="tr">of such ferocious stock should be retained,</p>
<p n="tr">she made that offspring in the shape of man;  </p>
<p n="tr">but this new race alike despised the Gods,</p>
<p n="tr">and by the greed of savage slaughter proved</p>
<p n="tr">a sanguinary birth.</p>

<p n="tr">When, from his throne</p>
<p n="tr">supreme, the Son of Saturn viewed their deeds,</p>
<p n="tr">he deeply groaned: and calling to his mind</p>
<p n="tr">the loathsome feast Lycaon had prepared,</p>
<p n="tr">a recent deed not common to report,</p>
<p n="tr">his soul conceived great anger worthy Jove </p>
<p n="tr">and he convened a council. No delay</p>
<p n="tr">detained the chosen Gods.</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">When skies are clear</p>
<p n="tr">a path is well defined on high, which men,</p>
<p n="tr">because so white, have named the Milky Way.</p>
<p n="tr">It makes a passage for the deities</p>
<p n="tr">and leads to mansions of the Thunder God,</p>
<p n="tr">to Jove's imperial home. On either side</p>
<p n="tr">of its wide way the noble Gods are seen,</p>
<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">inferior Gods in other parts abide,</p>
<p n="tr">but there the potent and renowned of Heaven</p>
<p n="tr">have fixed their homes.It is a glorious place,</p>
<p n="tr">our most audacious verse might designate</p>
<p n="tr">the Palace of High Heaven. When the Gods</p>
<p n="tr">were seated, therefore, in its marble halls</p>
<p n="tr">the King of all above the throng sat high,</p>
<p n="tr">and leaning on his ivory scepter, thrice,</p>
<p n="tr">and once again he shook his awful locks,</p>
<p n="tr">wherewith he moved the earth, and seas and stars,</p>
<p n="tr">and thus indignantly began to speak;</p>

<p n="tr">The time when serpent footed giants strove</p>
<p n="tr">to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">not more than this event could cause alarm</p>
<p n="tr">for my dominion of the universe.</p>
<p n="tr">Although it was a savage enemy,</p>
<p n="tr">yet warred we with a single source derived</p>
<p n="tr">of one. Now must I utterly destroy</p>
<p n="tr">this mortal race wherever Nereus roars</p>
<p n="tr">around the world. Yea, by the Infernal Streams</p>
<p n="tr">that glide through Stygian groves beneath the world,</p>
<p n="tr">I swear it. Every method has been tried.</p>
<p n="tr">The knife must cut immedicable wounds,</p>
<p n="tr">lest maladies infect untainted parts.</p>

<p n="tr">Beneath my sway are demi gods and fauns,</p>
<p n="tr">nymphs, rustic deities, sylvans of the hills,</p>
<p n="tr">satyrs;all these, unworthy Heaven's abodes,</p>
<p n="tr">we should at least permit to dwell on earth</p>
<p n="tr">which we to them bequeathed. What think ye, Gods,</p>
<p n="tr">is safety theirs when I, your sovereign lord,</p>
<p n="tr">the Thunder-bolt Controller, am ensnared</p>
<p n="tr">by fierce Lycaon? Ardent in their wrath,</p>
<p n="tr">the astonished Gods demand revenge overtake</p>
<p n="tr">this miscreant; he who dared commit such crimes.</p>
<p n="tr">'Twas even thus when raged that impious band</p>
<p n="tr">to blot the Roman name in sacred blood</p>
<p n="tr">of Caesar, sudden apprehensive fears</p>
<p n="tr">of ruin absolute astonished man,</p>
<p n="tr">and all the world convulsed. Nor is the love</p>
<p n="tr">thy people bear to thee, Augustus, less</p>
<p n="tr">than these displayed to <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName> whose voice</p>
<p n="tr">and gesture all the murmuring host restrained:</p>
<p n="tr">and as indignant clamour ceased, suppressed</p>
<p n="tr">by regnant majesty, Jove once again</p>
<p n="tr">broke the deep silence with imperial words;</p>

<p n="tr">Dismiss your cares; he paid the penalty</p>
<p n="tr">however all the crime and punishment</p>
<p n="tr">now learn from this:An infamous report</p>
<p n="tr">of this unholy age had reached my ears,</p>
<p n="tr">and wishing it were false, I sloped my course</p>
<p n="tr">from high <placeName key="tgn,2109778">Olympus</placeName>, andalthough a God</p>
<p n="tr">disguised in human form I viewed the world.</p>
<p n="tr">It would delay us to recount the crimes</p>
<p n="tr">unnumbered, for reports were less than truth.</p>

<p n="tr">I traversed Maenalus where fearful dens</p>
<p n="tr">abound, over Lycaeus, wintry slopes</p>
<p n="tr">of pine tree groves, across Cyllene steep;</p>
<p n="tr">and as the twilight warned of night's approach,</p>
<p n="tr">I stopped in that <placeName key="tgn,2136419">Arcadian</placeName> tyrant's realms</p>
<p n="tr">and entered his inhospitable home:</p>
<p n="tr">and when I showed his people that a God</p>
<p n="tr">had come, the lowly prayed and worshiped me,</p>
<p n="tr">but this Lycaon mocked their pious vows</p>
<p n="tr">and scoffing said; A fair experiment</p>
<p n="tr">will prove the truth if this be god or man.</p>
<p n="tr">and he prepared to slay me in the night,</p>
<p n="tr">to end my slumbers in the sleep of death.</p>
<p n="tr">So made he merry with his impious proof;</p>
<p n="tr">but not content with this he cut the throat</p>
<p n="tr">of a Molossian hostage sent to him,</p>
<p n="tr">and partly softened his still quivering limbs</p>
<p n="tr">in boiling water, partly roasted them</p>
<p n="tr">on fires that burned beneath. And when this flesh</p>
<p n="tr">was served to me on tables, I destroyed</p>
<p n="tr">his dwelling and his worthless Household Gods,</p>
<p n="tr">with thunder bolts avenging. Terror struck</p>
<p n="tr">he took to flight, and on the silent plains</p>
<p n="tr">is howling in his vain attempts to speak;</p>
<p n="tr">he raves and rages and his greedy jaws,</p>
<p n="tr">desiring their accustomed slaughter, turn</p>
<p n="tr">against the sheepstill eager for their blood.</p>
<p n="tr">His vesture separates in shaggy hair,</p>
<p n="tr">his arms are changed to legs; and as a wolf</p>
<p n="tr">he has the same grey locks, the same hard face,</p>
<p n="tr">the same bright eyes, the same ferocious look.</p>

<p n="tr">Thus fell one house, but not one house alone</p>

<p n="tr">the promised boon.For I confess, O son,</p>
<p n="tr">this only I should keep from theeand yet</p>
<p n="tr">'Tis lawful to dissuade. It is unsafe</p>
<p n="tr">to satisfy thy will. It is a great</p>
<p n="tr">request, O Phaethon, which neither suits</p>
<p n="tr">thy utmost strength nor tender years; for thou</p>
<p n="tr">art mortal, and thou hast aspired to things</p>
<p n="tr">immortal. Ignorance has made thy thought</p>
<p n="tr">transcend the province of the Gods. I vaunt</p>
<p n="tr">no vain exploits; but only I can stand</p>
<p n="tr">securely on the flame-fraught axle-tree:</p>
<p n="tr">even the Ruler of Olympian Gods,</p>
<p n="tr">who hurls fierce lightnings with his great right hand,</p>
<p n="tr">may never dare to drive this chariot,</p>
<p n="tr">and what art thou to equal mighty Jove?</p>

<p n="tr">The opening path is steep and difficult,</p>
<p n="tr">for scarcely can the steeds, refreshed at dawn,</p>
<p n="tr">climb up the steeps: and when is reached the height,</p>
<p n="tr">extreme of midmost Heaven, and sea and earth</p>
<p n="tr">are viewed below, my trembling breast is filled</p>
<p n="tr">with fearful apprehensions: and requires</p>
<p n="tr">the last precipitous descent a sure</p>
<p n="tr">command. Then, also, Tethys, who receives</p>
<p n="tr">me in her subject waves, is wont to fear</p>
<p n="tr">lest I should fall disastrous. And around</p>
<p n="tr">the hastening sky revolves in constant whirl,</p>
<p n="tr">drawing the lofty stars with rapid twist.</p>

<p n="tr">I struggle on. The force that overcomes</p>
<p n="tr">the heavenly bodies overwhelms me not,</p>
<p n="tr">and I am borne against that rapid globe.</p>
<p n="tr">Suppose the chariot thine: what canst thou do?</p>
<p n="tr">Canst thou drive straight against the twisted pole</p>
<p n="tr">and not be carried from the lofty path</p>
<p n="tr">by the swift car? Art thou deceived to think</p>
<p n="tr">there may be groves and cities of the Gods,</p>
<p n="tr">and costly temples wondrously endowed?</p>

<p n="tr">The journey is beset with dreadful snares</p>
<p n="tr">and shapes of savage animals. If thou</p>
<p n="tr">shouldst hold upon thy way without mistake</p>
<p n="tr">yet must thy journey be through Taurus' horns,</p>
<p n="tr">and through the Bow Haemonian, and the jaws</p>
<p n="tr">of the fierce Lion, and the cruel arms</p>
<p n="tr">of Scorpion, bent throughout a vast expanse,</p>
<p n="tr">and Cancer's curving arms reversely bent.</p>

<p n="tr">It is no easy task for thee to rule</p>
<p n="tr">the mettled four-foot steeds, enflamed in fires</p>
<p n="tr">that kindle in their breasts, forth issuing</p>
<p n="tr">in breathings from their mouths and nostrils hot;</p>
<p n="tr">I scarce restrain them, as their struggling necks</p>
<p n="tr">pull on the harness, when their heated fires</p>
<p n="tr">are thus aroused.</p>

<p n="tr">And, O my son, lest I</p>
<p n="tr">may be the author of a baneful gift,</p>
<p n="tr">beware, and as the time permits recall</p>
<p n="tr">thy rash request. Forsooth thou hast besought</p>
<p n="tr">undoubted signs of thy descent from me?</p>
<p n="tr">My fears for thee are certain signs that thou</p>
<p n="tr">art of my raceby my paternal fears</p>
<p n="tr">'Tis manifest I am thy father. Lo!</p>
<p n="tr">Behold my countenance! and oh, that thou</p>
<p n="tr">couldst even pierce my bosom with thine eyes,</p>
<p n="tr">and so discover my paternal cares!</p>

<p n="tr">Look round thee on the treasured world's delights</p>
<p n="tr">and ask the greatest blessing of the sky,</p>
<p n="tr">or sea or land, and thou shalt suffer no</p>
<p n="tr">repulse: but only this I must deplore,</p>
<p n="tr">which rightly named would be a penalty</p>
<p n="tr">and not an honour.Thou hast made request</p>
<p n="tr">of punishment and not a gift indeed.</p>
<p n="tr">O witless boy! why dost thou hold my neck</p>
<p n="tr">with thy caressing arms? For, doubt it not,</p>

<p n="tr">fondly to me, and vainly struggles up.</p>
<p n="tr">It seems that I could touch him. 'Tis a strange</p>

<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><p n="tr">But fearless he replied; They call my name</p>
<p n="tr">Acoetes; and <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Maeonia</placeName> is the land</p>
<p n="tr">from whence I came. My parents were so poor,</p>
<p n="tr">my father left me neither fruitful fields,</p>
<p n="tr">tilled by the lusty ox, nor fleecy sheep,</p>
<p n="tr">nor lowing kine; for, he himself was poor,</p>
<p n="tr">and with his hook and line was wont to catch</p>
<p n="tr">the leaping fishes, landed by his rod.</p>
<p n="tr">His skill was all his wealth. And when to me</p>
<p n="tr">he gave his trade, he said, You are the heir</p>
<p n="tr">of my employment, therefore unto you</p>
<p n="tr">all that is mine I give, and, at his death,</p>
<p n="tr">he left me nothing but the running waves. </p>
<p n="tr">they are the sum of my inheritance.</p>

<p n="tr">And, afterwhile, that I might not be bound</p>
<p n="tr">forever to my father's rocky shores,</p>
<p n="tr">I learned to steer the keel with dextrous hand;</p>
<p n="tr">and marked with watchful gaze the guiding stars;</p>
<p n="tr">the watery Constellation of the Goat,</p>
<p n="tr">Olenian, and the Bear, the Hyades,</p>
<p n="tr">the Pleiades, the houses of the winds,</p>
<p n="tr">and every harbour suitable for ships.</p>

<p n="tr">So chanced it, as I made for <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, first</p>
<p n="tr">I veered close to the shores of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>: there</p>
<p n="tr">I steered, by plying on the starboard oar,</p>
<p n="tr">and nimbly leaping gained the sea-wet strand.</p>

<p n="tr">Now when the night was past and lovely dawn</p>
<p n="tr">appeared, I,rose from slumber, and I bade</p>
<p n="tr">my men to fetch fresh water, and I showed</p>
<p n="tr">the pathway to the stream. Then did I climb</p>
<p n="tr">a promontory's height, to learn from there</p>
<p n="tr">the promise of the winds; which having done,</p>
<p n="tr">I called the men and sought once more my ship.</p>
<p n="tr">Opheltes, first of my companions, cried,</p>
<p n="tr">Behold we come! And, thinking he had caught</p>
<p n="tr">a worthy prize in that unfruitful land,</p>
<p n="tr">he led a boy, of virgin-beauty formed,</p>
<p n="tr">across the shore.</p>

<p n="tr">Heavy with wine and sleep</p>
<p n="tr">the lad appeared to stagger on his way,</p>
<p n="tr">with difficulty moving. When I saw</p>
<p n="tr">the manner of his dress, his countenance</p>
<p n="tr">and grace, I knew it was not mortal man,</p>
<p n="tr">and being well assured, I said to them;</p>
<p n="tr">What Deity abideth in that form</p>
<p n="tr">I cannot say; but 'tis a god in truth.</p>
<p n="tr">O whosoever thou art, vouchsafe to us</p>
<p n="tr">propitious waters; ease our toils, and grant</p>
<p n="tr">to these thy grace.</p>

<p n="tr">At this, the one of all</p>
<p n="tr">my mariners who was the quickest hand,</p>
<p n="tr">who ever was the nimblest on the yards,</p>
<p n="tr">and first to slip the ropes, Dictys exclaimed;</p>
<p n="tr">Pray not for us! and all approved his words.</p>
<p n="tr">The golden haired, the guardian of the prow,</p>
<p n="tr">Melanthus, Libys and Alcimedon</p>
<p n="tr">approved it; and Epopeus who should urge</p>
<p n="tr">the flagging spirits, and with rhythmic chants</p>
<p n="tr">give time and measure to the beating oars,</p>
<p n="tr">and all the others praised their leader's words,</p>
<p n="tr">so blind is greed of gain.Then I rejoined,</p>
<p n="tr">Mine is the greatest share in this good ship,</p>
<p n="tr">which I will not permit to be destroyed,</p>
<p n="tr">nor injured by this sacred freight: and I</p>
<p n="tr">opposed them as they came.</p>

<p n="tr">Then Lycabas,</p>
<p n="tr">the most audacious of that impious crew,</p>
<p n="tr">began to rage. He was a criminal,</p>
<p n="tr">who, for a dreadful murder, had been sent</p>
<p n="tr">in exile from a Tuscan city's gates.</p>
<p n="tr">Whilst I opposed he gripped me by the throat,</p>
<p n="tr">and shook me as would cast me in the deep,</p>
<p n="tr">had I not firmly held a rope, half stunned:</p>
<p n="tr">and all that wicked crew approved the deed.</p>

<p n="tr">Then Bacchus (be assured it was the God)</p>
<p n="tr">as though the noise disturbed his lethargy</p>
<p n="tr">from wine, and reason had regained its power,</p>
<p n="tr">at last bespake the men, What deeds are these?</p>
<p n="tr">What noise assails my ears? What means decoyed</p>
<p n="tr">my wandering footsteps? Whither do ye lead?</p>
<p n="tr">Fear not, the steersman said, but tell us fair</p>
<p n="tr">the haven of your hope, and you shall land</p>
<p n="tr">whereso your heart desires. To <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> steer,</p>
<p n="tr">Quoth Bacchus, for it is indeed my home,</p>
<p n="tr">and there the mariner finds welcome cheer.</p>
<p n="tr">Him to deceive, they pledged themselves, and swore</p>
<p n="tr">by Gods of seas and skies to do his will:</p>
<p n="tr">and they commanded me to steer that way.</p>

<p n="tr">The Isle of <placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName> was upon our right;</p>
<p n="tr">and when they saw the sails were set that way,</p>
<p n="tr">they all began to shout at once, What, ho!</p>
<p n="tr">Thou madman! what insanity is this,</p>
<p n="tr">Acoetes? Make our passage to the left.</p>
<p n="tr">And all the while they made their meaning known</p>
<p n="tr">by artful signs or whispers in my ears.</p>

<p n="tr">I was amazed and answered, Take the helm.</p>
<p n="tr">And I refused to execute their will,</p>
<p n="tr">atrocious, and at once resigned command.</p>
<p n="tr">Then all began to murmur, and the crew</p>
<p n="tr">reviled me. Up Aethalion jumped and said,</p>
<p n="tr">As if our only safety is in you!</p>
<p n="tr">With this he swaggered up and took command;</p>
<p n="tr">and leaving <placeName key="tgn,7003909">Naxos</placeName> steered for other shores.</p>

<p n="tr">Then Bacchus, mocking them,as if but then</p>
<p n="tr">he had discovered their deceitful ways,</p>
<p n="tr">looked on the ocean from the rounded stern,</p>
<p n="tr">and seemed to sob as he addressed the men;</p>
<p n="tr">Ah mariners, what alien shores are these?</p>
<p n="tr">'Tis not the land you promised nor the port</p>
<p n="tr">my heart desires. For what have I deserved</p>
<p n="tr">this cruel wrong? What honour can accrue</p>
<p n="tr">if strong men mock a boy; a lonely youth</p>
<p n="tr">if many should deceive? And as he spoke,</p>
<p n="tr">I, also, wept to see their wickedness.</p>

<p n="tr">The impious gang made merry at our tears,</p>
<p n="tr">and lashed the billows with their quickening oars.</p>
<p n="tr">By Bacchus do I swear to you (and naught</p>
<p n="tr">celestial is more potent) all the things</p>
<p n="tr">I tell you are as true as they surpass</p>
<p n="tr">the limit of belief. The ship stood still</p>
<p n="tr">as if a dry dock held it in the sea.</p>

<p n="tr">The wondering sailors laboured at the oars,</p>
<p n="tr">and they unfurled the sails, in hopes to gain</p>
<p n="tr">some headway, with redoubled energies;</p>
<p n="tr">but twisting ivy tangled in the oars,</p>
<p n="tr">and interlacing held them by its weight.</p>
<p n="tr">And Bacchus in the midst of all stood crowned</p>
<p n="tr">with chaplets of grape-leaves, and shook a lance</p>
<p n="tr">covered with twisted fronds of leafy vines.</p>
<p n="tr">Around him crouched the visionary forms</p>
<p n="tr">of tigers, lynxes, and the mottled shapes</p>
<p n="tr">of panthers.</p>

<p n="tr">Then the mariners leaped out,</p>
<p n="tr">possessed by fear or madness. Medon first</p>
<p n="tr">began to turn a swarthy hue, and fins</p>
<p n="tr">grew outward from his flattened trunk,</p>
<p n="tr">and with a curving spine his body bent.</p>
<p n="tr">then Lycabas to him, What prodigy</p>
<p n="tr">is this that I behold? Even as he spoke,</p>
<p n="tr">his jaws were broadened and his nose was bent;</p>
<p n="tr">his hardened skin was covered with bright scales.</p>
<p n="tr">And Libys, as he tried to pull the oars,</p>
<p n="tr">could see his own hands shrivel into fins;</p>
<p n="tr">another of the crew began to grasp</p>
<p n="tr">the twisted ropes, but even as he strove</p>
<p n="tr">to lift his arms they fastened to his sides;</p>
<p n="tr">with bending body and a crooked back</p>
<p n="tr">he plunged into the waves, and as he swam</p>
<p n="tr">displayed a tail, as crescent as the moon.</p>

<p n="tr">Now here, now there, they flounce about the ship;</p>
<p n="tr">they spray her decks with brine; they rise and sink;</p>
<p n="tr">they rise again, and dive beneath the waves;</p>
<p n="tr">they seem in sportive dance upon the main;</p>
<p n="tr">out from their nostrils they spout sprays of brine;</p>
<p n="tr">they toss their supple sides. And I alone,</p>
<p n="tr">of twenty mariners that manned that ship,</p>
<p n="tr">remained. A cold chill seized my limbs,</p>
<p n="tr">I was so frightened; but the gracious God</p>
<p n="tr">now spake me fair, Fear not and steer for <placeName key="tgn,7003909">Naxos</placeName>.</p>

<p n="tr">refused all payment, adding perjury</p>

<p n="tr">This awful punishment was not enough.</p>
<p n="tr">The daughter of the king was soon required</p>

<p n="tr">all payment was denied to him for his</p>

<p n="tr">up from a deep wave, said, Hark unto me,</p>
