<p n="tr">Arms and the man I sing, who first made way,</p>
<p n="tr">predestined exile, from the Trojan shore</p>
<p n="tr">to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the blest Lavinian strand.</p>
<p n="tr">Smitten of storms he was on land and sea</p>
<p n="tr">by violence of Heaven, to satisfy</p>
<p n="tr">stern Juno's sleepless wrath; and much in war</p>
<p n="tr">he suffered, seeking at the last to found </p>
<p n="tr">the city, and bring o'er his fathers' gods</p>
<p n="tr">to safe abode in <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>; whence arose</p>
<p n="tr">the Latin race, old Alba's reverend lords,</p>
<p n="tr">and from her hills wide-walled, imperial <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="8" unit="card"/>O Muse, the causes tell! What sacrilege,</p>
<p n="tr">or vengeful sorrow, moved the heavenly Queen</p>
<p n="tr">to thrust on dangers dark and endless toil</p>
<p n="tr">a man whose largest honor in men's eyes</p>
<p n="tr">was serving Heaven? Can gods such anger feel?</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="12" unit="card"/>In ages gone an ancient city stood</p>
<p n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, a Tyrian seat, which from afar</p>
<p n="tr">made front on <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and on the mouths</p>
<p n="tr">of <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>'s stream; its wealth and revenues</p>
<p n="tr">were vast, and ruthless was its quest of war.</p>
<p n="tr">'T is said that Juno, of all lands she loved,</p>
<p n="tr">most cherished this,not <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>' self so dear.</p>
<p n="tr">Here were her arms, her chariot; even then</p>
<p n="tr">a throne of power o'er nations near and far,</p>
<p n="tr">if Fate opposed not, 't was her darling hope</p>
<p n="tr">to 'stablish here; but anxiously she heard</p>
<p n="tr">that of the Trojan blood there was a breed</p>
<p n="tr">then rising, which upon the destined day</p>
<p n="tr">should utterly o'erwhelm her Tyrian towers,</p>
<p n="tr">a people of wide sway and conquest proud</p>
<p n="tr">should compass <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>'s doom;such was the web</p>
<p n="tr">the Fatal Sisters spun. Such was the fear</p>
<p n="tr">of Saturn's daughter, who remembered well</p>
<p n="tr">what long and unavailing strife she waged</p>
<p n="tr">for her loved Greeks at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Nor did she fail</p>
<p n="tr">to meditate th' occasions of her rage,</p>
<p n="tr">and cherish deep within her bosom proud</p>
<p n="tr">its griefs and wrongs: the choice by <persName>Paris</persName> made;</p>
<p n="tr">her scorned and slighted beauty; a whole race</p>
<p n="tr">rebellious to her godhead; and Jove's smile</p>
<p n="tr">that beamed on eagle-ravished Ganymede.</p>
<p n="tr">With all these thoughts infuriate, her power</p>
<p n="tr">pursued with tempests o'er the boundless main</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojans, though by Grecian victor spared</p>
<p n="tr">and fierce Achilles; so she thrust them far</p>
<p n="tr">from <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>; and they drifted, Heaven-impelled,</p>
<p n="tr">year after year, o'er many an unknown sea</p>
<p n="tr">O labor vast, to found the Roman line!</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="34" unit="card"/>Below th' horizon the Sicilian isle</p>
<p n="tr">just sank from view, as for the open sea</p>
<p n="tr">with heart of hope they sailed, and every ship</p>
<p n="tr">clove with its brazen beak the salt, white waves.</p>
<p n="tr">But Juno of her everlasting wound</p>
<p n="tr">knew no surcease, but from her heart of pain</p>
<p n="tr">thus darkly mused: Must I, defeated, fail</p>
<p n="tr">of what I will, nor turn the Teucrian King</p>
<p n="tr">from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> away? Can Fate oppose?</p>
<p n="tr">Had Pallas power to lay waste in flame</p>
<p n="tr">the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet and sink its mariners,</p>
<p n="tr">revenging but the sacrilege obscene</p>
<p n="tr">by Ajax wrought, Oileus' desperate son?</p>
<p n="tr">She, from the clouds, herself Jove's lightning threw,</p>
<p n="tr">scattered the ships, and ploughed the sea with storms.</p>
<p n="tr">Her foe, from his pierced breast out-breathing fire,</p>
<p n="tr">in whirlwind on a deadly rock she flung.</p>
<p n="tr">But I, who move among the gods a queen,</p>
<p n="tr">Jove's sister and his spouse, with one weak tribe</p>
<p n="tr">make war so long! Who now on Juno calls?</p>
<p n="tr">What suppliant gifts henceforth her altars crown?</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="card"/>So, in her fevered heart complaining still,</p>
<p n="tr">unto the storm-cloud land the goddess came,</p>
<p n="tr">a region with wild whirlwinds in its womb,</p>
<p n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,5004216">Aeolia</placeName> named, where royal Aeolus</p>
<p n="tr">in a high-vaulted cavern keeps control</p>
<p n="tr">o'er warring winds and loud concourse of storms.</p>
<p n="tr">There closely pent in chains and bastions strong,</p>
<p n="tr">they, scornful, make the vacant mountain roar,</p>
<p n="tr">chafing against their bonds. But from a throne</p>
<p n="tr">of lofty crag, their king with sceptred hand</p>
<p n="tr">allays their fury and their rage confines.</p>
<p n="tr">Did he not so, our ocean, earth, and sky</p>
<p n="tr">were whirled before them through the vast inane.</p>
<p n="tr">But over-ruling Jove, of this in fear,</p>
<p n="tr">hid them in dungeon dark: then o'er them piled</p>
<p n="tr">huge mountains, and ordained a lawful king</p>
<p n="tr">to hold them in firm sway, or know what time,</p>
<p n="tr">with Jove's consent, to loose them o'er the world.</p>
<p n="tr">To him proud Juno thus made lowly plea:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="card"/>Thou in whose hands the Father of all gods</p>
<p n="tr">and Sovereign of mankind confides the power</p>
<p n="tr">to calm the waters or with winds upturn,</p>
<p n="tr">great Aeolus! a race with me at war</p>
<p n="tr">now sails the Tuscan main towards <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,</p>
<p n="tr">bringing their <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName> and its vanquished powers.</p>
<p n="tr">Uprouse thy gales. Strike that proud navy down!</p>
<p n="tr">Hurl far and wide, and strew the waves with dead!</p>
<p n="tr">Twice seven nymphs are mine, of rarest mould;</p>
<p n="tr">of whom Deiopea, the most fair,</p>
<p n="tr">I give thee in true wedlock for thine own,</p>
<p n="tr">to mate thy noble worth; she at thy side</p>
<p n="tr">shall pass long, happy years, and fruitful bring</p>
<p n="tr">her beauteous offspring unto thee their sire.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="76" unit="card"/>Then Aeolus: 'T is thy sole task, O Queen,</p>
<p n="tr">to weigh thy wish and will. My fealty</p>
<p n="tr">thy high behest obeys. This humble throne</p>
<p n="tr">is of thy gift. Thy smiles for me obtain</p>
<p n="tr">authority from Jove. Thy grace concedes</p>
<p n="tr">my station at your bright Olympian board,</p>
<p n="tr">and gives me lordship of the darkening storm.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="81" unit="card"/>Replying thus, he smote with spear reversed</p>
<p n="tr">the hollow mountain's wall; then rush the winds</p>
<p n="tr">through that wide breach in long, embattled line,</p>
<p n="tr">and sweep tumultuous from land to land:</p>
<p n="tr">with brooding pinions o'er the waters spread,</p>
<p n="tr">east wind and south, and boisterous Afric gale</p>
<p n="tr">upturn the sea; vast billows shoreward roll;</p>
<p n="tr">the shout of mariners, the creak of cordage,</p>
<p n="tr">follow the shock; low-hanging clouds conceal</p>
<p n="tr">from Trojan eyes all sight of heaven and day;</p>
<p n="tr">night o'er the ocean broods; from sky to sky</p>
<p n="tr">the thunders roll, the ceaseless lightnings glare;</p>
<p n="tr">and all things mean swift death for mortal man.</p>
<p n="tr">Straightway Aeneas, shuddering with amaze,</p>
<p n="tr">groaned loud, upraised both holy hands to Heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">and thus did plead: O thrice and four times blest,</p>
<p n="tr">ye whom your sires and whom the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></p>
<p n="tr">looked on in your last hour! O bravest son</p>
<p n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> ever bore, Tydides! O that I</p>
<p n="tr">had fallen on Ilian fields, and given this life</p>
<p n="tr">struck down by thy strong hand! where by the spear</p>
<p n="tr">of great Achilles, fiery Hector fell,</p>
<p n="tr">and huge Sarpedon; where the Simois</p>
<p n="tr">in furious flood engulfed and whirled away</p>
<p n="tr">so many helms and shields and heroes slain!</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="102" unit="card"/>While thus he cried to Heaven, a shrieking blast</p>
<p n="tr">smote full upon the sail. Up surged the waves</p>
<p n="tr">to strike the very stars; in fragments flew</p>
<p n="tr">the shattered oars; the helpless vessel veered</p>
<p n="tr">and gave her broadside to the roaring flood,</p>
<p n="tr">where watery mountains rose and burst and fell.</p>
<p n="tr">Now high in air she hangs, then yawning gulfs</p>
<p n="tr">lay bare the shoals and sands o'er which she drives.</p>
<p n="tr">Three ships a whirling south wind snatched and flung</p>
<p n="tr">on hidden rocks,altars of sacrifice</p>
<p n="tr">Italians call them, which lie far from shore</p>
<p n="tr">a vast ridge in the sea; three ships beside</p>
<p n="tr">an east wind, blowing landward from the deep,</p>
<p n="tr">drove on the shallows,pitiable sight,</p>
<p n="tr">and girdled them in walls of drifting sand.</p>
<p n="tr">That ship, which, with his friend Orontes, bore</p>
<p n="tr">the Lycian mariners, a great, plunging wave</p>
<p n="tr">struck straight astern, before Aeneas' eyes.</p>
<p n="tr">Forward the steersman rolled and o'er the side</p>
<p n="tr">fell headlong, while three times the circling flood</p>
<p n="tr">spun the light bark through swift engulfing seas.</p>
<p n="tr">Look, how the lonely swimmers breast the wave!</p>
<p n="tr">And on the waste of waters wide are seen</p>
<p n="tr">weapons of war, spars, planks, and treasures rare,</p>
<p n="tr">once <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s boast, all mingled with the storm.</p>
<p n="tr">Now o'er Achates and Ilioneus,</p>
<p n="tr">now o'er the ship of Abas or Aletes,</p>
<p n="tr">bursts the tempestuous shock; their loosened seams</p>
<p n="tr">yawn wide and yield the angry wave its will.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="124" unit="card"/>Meanwhile how all his smitten ocean moaned,</p>
<p n="tr">and how the tempest's turbulent assault</p>
<p n="tr">had vexed the stillness of his deepest cave,</p>
<p n="tr">great Neptune knew; and with indignant mien</p>
<p n="tr">uplifted o'er the sea his sovereign brow.</p>
<p n="tr">He saw the Teucrian navy scattered far</p>
<p n="tr">along the waters; and Aeneas' men</p>
<p n="tr">o'erwhelmed in mingling shock of wave and sky.</p>
<p n="tr">Saturnian Juno's vengeful stratagem</p>
<p n="tr">her brother's royal glance failed not to see;</p>
<p n="tr">and loud to eastward and to westward calling,</p>
<p n="tr">he voiced this word:<milestone ed="p" n="132" unit="card"/>What pride of birth or power</p>
<p n="tr">is yours, ye winds, that, reckless of my will,</p>
<p n="tr">audacious thus, ye ride through earth and heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">and stir these mountain waves? Such rebels I</p>
<p n="tr">nay, first I calm this tumult! But yourselves</p>
<p n="tr">by heavier chastisement shall expiate</p>
<p n="tr">hereafter your bold trespass. Haste away</p>
<p n="tr">and bear your king this word! Not unto him</p>
<p n="tr">dominion o'er the seas and trident dread,</p>
<p n="tr">but unto me, Fate gives. Let him possess</p>
<p n="tr">wild mountain crags, thy favored haunt and home,</p>
<p n="tr">O Eurus! In his barbarous mansion there,</p>
<p n="tr">let Aeolus look proud, and play the king</p>
<p n="tr">in yon close-bounded prison-house of storms!</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="142" unit="card"/>He spoke, and swiftlier than his word subdued</p>
<p n="tr">the swelling of the floods; dispersed afar</p>
<p n="tr">th' assembled clouds, and brought back light to heaven.</p>
<p n="tr">Cymothoe then and Triton, with huge toil,</p>
<p n="tr">thrust down the vessels from the sharp-edged reef;</p>
<p n="tr">while, with the trident, the great god's own hand</p>
<p n="tr">assists the task; then, from the sand-strewn shore</p>
<p n="tr">out-ebbing far, he calms the whole wide sea,</p>
<p n="tr">and glides light-wheeled along the crested foam.</p>
<p n="tr">As when, with not unwonted tumult, roars</p>
<p n="tr">in some vast city a rebellious mob,</p>
<p n="tr">and base-born passions in its bosom burn,</p>
<p n="tr">till rocks and blazing torches fill the air</p>
<p n="tr">(rage never lacks for arms)if haply then</p>
<p n="tr">some wise man comes, whose reverend looks attest</p>
<p n="tr">a life to duty given, swift silence falls;</p>
<p n="tr">all ears are turned attentive; and he sways</p>
<p n="tr">with clear and soothing speech the people's will.</p>
<p n="tr">So ceased the sea's uproar, when its grave Sire</p>
<p n="tr">looked o'er th' expanse, and, riding on in light,</p>
<p n="tr">flung free rein to his winged obedient car.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="157" unit="card"/>Aeneas' wave-worn crew now landward made,</p>
<p n="tr">and took the nearest passage, whither lay</p>
<p n="tr">the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. A haven there</p>
<p n="tr">walled in by bold sides of a rocky isle,</p>
<p n="tr">offers a spacious and secure retreat,</p>
<p n="tr">where every billow from the distant main</p>
<p n="tr">breaks, and in many a rippling curve retires.</p>
<p n="tr">Huge crags and two confronted promontories</p>
<p n="tr">frown heaven-high, beneath whose brows outspread</p>
<p n="tr">the silent, sheltered waters; on the heights</p>
<p n="tr">the bright and glimmering foliage seems to show</p>
<p n="tr">a woodland amphitheatre; and yet higher</p>
<p n="tr">rises a straight-stemmed grove of dense, dark shade.</p>
<p n="tr">Fronting on these a grotto may be seen,</p>
<p n="tr">o'erhung by steep cliffs; from its inmost wall</p>
<p n="tr">clear springs gush out; and shelving seats it has</p>
<p n="tr">of unhewn stone, a place the wood-nymphs love.</p>
<p n="tr">In such a port, a weary ship rides free</p>
<p n="tr">of weight of firm-fluked anchor or strong chain.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="card"/>Hither Aeneas of his scattered fleet</p>
<p n="tr">saving but seven, into harbor sailed;</p>
<p n="tr">with passionate longing for the touch of land,</p>
<p n="tr">forth leap the Trojans to the welcome shore,</p>
<p n="tr">and fling their dripping limbs along the ground.</p>
<p n="tr">Then good Achates smote a flinty stone,</p>
<p n="tr">secured a flashing spark, heaped on light leaves,</p>
<p n="tr">and with dry branches nursed the mounting flame.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Ceres' gift from the corrupting sea</p>
<p n="tr">they bring away; and wearied utterly</p>
<p n="tr">ply Ceres' cunning on the rescued corn,</p>
<p n="tr">and parch in flames, and mill 'twixt two smooth stones.</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas meanwhile climbed the cliffs, and searched</p>
<p n="tr">the wide sea-prospect; haply Antheus there,</p>
<p n="tr">storm-buffeted, might sail within his ken,</p>
<p n="tr">with biremes, and his Phrygian mariners,</p>
<p n="tr">or Capys or <placeName key="tgn,1121615">Caicus</placeName> armor-clad,</p>
<p n="tr">upon a towering deck. No ship is seen;</p>
<p n="tr">but while he looks, three stags along the shore</p>
<p n="tr">come straying by, and close behind them comes</p>
<p n="tr">the whole herd, browsing through the lowland vale</p>
<p n="tr">in one long line. Aeneas stopped and seized</p>
<p n="tr">his bow and swift-winged arrows, which his friend,</p>
<p n="tr">trusty Achates, close beside him bore.</p>
<p n="tr">His first shafts brought to earth the lordly heads</p>
<p n="tr">of the high-antlered chiefs; his next assailed</p>
<p n="tr">the general herd, and drove them one and all</p>
<p n="tr">in panic through the leafy wood, nor ceased</p>
<p n="tr">the victory of his bow, till on the ground</p>
<p n="tr">lay seven huge forms, one gift for every ship.</p>
<p n="tr">Then back to shore he sped, and to his friends</p>
<p n="tr">distributed the spoil, with that rare wine</p>
<p n="tr">which good Acestes while in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName></p>
<p n="tr">had stored in jars, and prince-like sent away</p>
<p n="tr">with his Ioved guest;this too Aeneas gave;</p>
<p n="tr">and with these words their mournful mood consoled.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="198" unit="card"/>Companions mine, we have not failed to feel</p>
<p n="tr">calamity till now. O, ye have borne</p>
<p n="tr">far heavier sorrow: Jove will make an end</p>
<p n="tr">also of this. Ye sailed a course hard by</p>
<p n="tr">infuriate Scylla's howling cliffs and caves.</p>
<p n="tr">Ye knew the Cyclops' crags. Lift up your hearts!</p>
<p n="tr">No more complaint and fear! It well may be</p>
<p n="tr">some happier hour will find this memory fair.</p>
<p n="tr">Through chance and change and hazard without end,</p>
<p n="tr">our goal is <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>; where our destinies</p>
<p n="tr">beckon to blest abodes, and have ordained</p>
<p n="tr">that <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> shall rise new-born! Have patience all!</p>
<p n="tr">And bide expectantly that golden day.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="208" unit="card"/>Such was his word, but vexed with grief and care,</p>
<p n="tr">feigned hopes upon his forehead firm he wore,</p>
<p n="tr">and locked within his heart a hero's pain.</p>
<p n="tr">Now round the welcome trophies of his chase</p>
<p n="tr">they gather for a feast. Some flay the ribs</p>
<p n="tr">and bare the flesh below; some slice with knives,</p>
<p n="tr">and on keen prongs the quivering strips impale,</p>
<p n="tr">place cauldrons on the shore, and fan the fires.</p>
<p n="tr">Then, stretched at ease on couch of simple green,</p>
<p n="tr">they rally their lost powers, and feast them well</p>
<p n="tr">on seasoned wine and succulent haunch of game.</p>
<p n="tr">But hunger banished and the banquet done,</p>
<p n="tr">in long discourse of their lost mates they tell,</p>
<p n="tr">'twixt hopes and fears divided; for who knows</p>
<p n="tr">whether the lost ones live, or strive with death,</p>
<p n="tr">or heed no more whatever voice may call?</p>
<p n="tr">Chiefly Aeneas now bewails his friends,</p>
<p n="tr">Orontes brave and fallen Amycus,</p>
<p n="tr">or mourns with grief untold the untimely doom</p>
<p n="tr">of bold young Gyas and Cloanthus bold.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="223" unit="card"/>After these things were past, exalted Jove,</p>
<p n="tr">from his ethereal sky surveying clear</p>
<p n="tr">the seas all winged with sails, lands widely spread,</p>
<p n="tr">and nations populous from shore to shore,</p>
<p n="tr">paused on the peak of heaven, and fixed his gaze</p>
<p n="tr">on <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. But while he anxious mused,</p>
<p n="tr">near him, her radiant eyes all dim with tears,</p>
<p n="tr">nor smiling any more, Venus approached,</p>
<p n="tr">and thus complained: O thou who dost control</p>
<p n="tr">things human and divine by changeless laws,</p>
<p n="tr">enthroned in awful thunder! What huge wrong</p>
<p n="tr">could my Aeneas and his Trojans few</p>
<p n="tr">achieve against thy power? For they have borne</p>
<p n="tr">unnumbered deaths, and, failing <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,</p>
<p n="tr">the gates of all the world against them close.</p>
<p n="tr">Hast thou not given us thy covenant</p>
<p n="tr">that hence the Romans when the rolling years</p>
<p n="tr">have come full cycle, shall arise to power</p>
<p n="tr">from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s regenerate seed, and rule supreme</p>
<p n="tr">the unresisted lords of land and sea?</p>
<p n="tr">O Sire, what swerves thy will? How oft have I</p>
<p n="tr">in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s most lamentable wreck and woe</p>
<p n="tr">consoled my heart with this, and balanced oft</p>
<p n="tr">our destined good against our destined ill!</p>
<p n="tr">But the same stormful fortune still pursues</p>
<p n="tr">my band of heroes on their perilous way.</p>
<p n="tr">When shall these labors cease, O glorious King?</p>
<p n="tr">Antenor, though th' Achaeans pressed him sore,</p>
<p n="tr">found his way forth, and entered unassailed</p>
<p n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName>'s haven, and the guarded land</p>
<p n="tr">of the Liburni. Straight up stream he sailed</p>
<p n="tr">where like a swollen sea Timavus pours</p>
<p n="tr">a nine-fold flood from roaring mountain gorge,</p>
<p n="tr">and whelms with voiceful wave the fields below.</p>
<p n="tr">He built <placeName key="perseus,Patavium">Patavium</placeName> there, and fixed abodes</p>
<p n="tr">for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s far-exiled sons; he gave a name</p>
<p n="tr">to a new land and race; the Trojan arms</p>
<p n="tr">were hung on temple walls; and, to this day,</p>

<p n="tr">I trace the larger outline of her story:</p>
<p n="tr">Sichreus was her spouse, whose acres broad</p>
<p n="tr">no Tyrian lord could match, and he was-blessed</p>
<p n="tr">by his ill-fated lady's fondest love,</p>
<p n="tr">whose father gave him her first virgin bloom</p>
<p n="tr">in youthful marriage. But the kingly power</p>
<p n="tr">among the Tyrians to her brother came,</p>
<p n="tr">Pygmalion, none deeper dyed in crime</p>
<p n="tr">in all that land. Betwixt these twain there rose</p>
<p n="tr">a deadly hatred,and the impious wretch,</p>
<p n="tr">blinded by greed, and reckless utterly</p>
<p n="tr">of his fond sister's joy, did murder foul</p>
<p n="tr">upon defenceless and unarmed Sichaeus,</p>
<p n="tr">and at the very altar hewed him down.</p>
<p n="tr">Long did he hide the deed, and guilefully</p>
<p n="tr">deceived with false hopes, and empty words,</p>
<p n="tr">her grief and stricken love. But as she slept,</p>
<p n="tr">her husband's tombless ghost before her came,</p>
<p n="tr">with face all wondrous pale, and he laid bare</p>
<p n="tr">his heart with dagger pierced, disclosing so</p>
<p n="tr">the blood-stained altar and the infamy</p>
<p n="tr">that darkened now their house. His counsel was</p>
<p n="tr">to fly, self-banished, from her ruined land,</p>
<p n="tr">and for her journey's aid, he whispered where</p>
<p n="tr">his buried treasure lay, a weight unknown</p>
<p n="tr">of silver and of gold. Thus onward urged,</p>
<p n="tr">Dido, assembling her few trusted friends,</p>
<p n="tr">prepared her flight. There rallied to her cause</p>
<p n="tr">all who did hate and scorn the tyrant king,</p>
<p n="tr">or feared his cruelty. They seized his ships,</p>
<p n="tr">which haply rode at anchor in the bay,</p>
<p n="tr">and loaded them with gold; the hoarded wealth</p>
<p n="tr">of vile and covetous Pygmalion</p>
<p n="tr">they took to sea. A woman wrought this deed.</p>

<p n="tr">One only comes not, who before our eyes </p>

<p n="tr">impels? What power to this wild coast has borne?</p>
<p n="tr">Art thou Aeneas, great Anchises' son,</p>
<p n="tr">whom lovely Venus by the Phrygian stream</p>
<p n="tr">of Simois brought forth unto the day?</p>
<p n="tr">Now I bethink me of when Teucer came</p>

<p n="tr">desired a second throne. For Belus then,</p>

<p n="tr">of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, as its conqueror and king.</p>
<p n="tr">And since that hour I oft have heard the tale</p>
<p n="tr">of fallen <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, of thine own noble name,</p>
<p n="tr">and of Achaean kings. Teucer was wont,</p>
<p n="tr">although their foe, to praise the Teucrian race,</p>
<p n="tr">and boasted him of that proud lineage sprung.</p>
<p n="tr">Therefore, behold, our portals are swung wide</p>

<p n="tr">hard fate like thine. I too was driven of storms</p>
<p n="tr">and after long toil was allowed at last</p>
<p n="tr">to call this land my home. O, I am wise</p>
<p n="tr">in sorrow, and I help all suffering souls!</p>
<p n="tr">So saying, she bade Aeneas welcome take</p>
<p n="tr">beneath her royal roof, and to the gods</p>
<p n="tr">made sacrifice in temples, while she sent</p>

<p n="tr">Her palace showed a monarch's fair array</p>

<p n="tr">a sceptre, too, once fair Ilione's,</p>

<p n="tr">Sooth, Venus feared the many-languaged guile</p>
<p n="tr">which Tyrians use; fierce Juno's hate she feared,</p>
<p n="tr">and falling night renewed her sleepless care.</p>
<p n="tr">Therefore to Love, the light-winged god, she said:</p>
<p n="tr">Sweet son, of whom my sovereignty and power</p>

<p n="tr">thy help divine. Behold, from land to land</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas, thine own brother, voyages on</p>
<p n="tr">storm-driven, by Juno's causeless enmity.</p>
<p n="tr">Thou knowest it well, and oft hast sighed to see</p>
<p n="tr">my sighs and tears. Dido the Tyrian now</p>
<p n="tr">detains him with soft speeches; and I fear</p>
<p n="tr">such courtesy from Juno means us ill;</p>
<p n="tr">she is not one who, when the hour is ripe,</p>

<p n="tr">the Tyrian Queen to snare, and siege her breast</p>
<p n="tr">with our invading fire, before some god</p>
<p n="tr">shall change her mood. But let her bosom burn</p>
<p n="tr">with love of my Aeneas not less than mine.</p>
<p n="tr">This thou canst bring to pass. I pray thee hear</p>
<p n="tr">the plan I counsel. At his father's call</p>
<p n="tr">Ascanius, heir of kings, makes haste to climb</p>
<p n="tr">to yon Sidonian citadel; my grace</p>
<p n="tr">protects him, and he bears gifts which were saved</p>

<p n="tr">our stratagem, and burst in, foiling all.</p>
<p n="tr">Wear thou his shape for one brief night thyself,</p>

<p n="tr">it has been vowed to Heaven for safe return,</p>
<p n="tr">and spread this lie abroad. Then they conceal</p>
<p n="tr">choice bands of warriors in the deep, dark side,</p>

<p n="tr">Here! cried we, the Dolopian pitched; the host</p>

<p n="tr">But Capys, as did all of wiser heart,</p>

<p n="tr">or underneath it thrust a kindling flame</p>
<p n="tr">or pierce the hollow ambush of its womb</p>
<p n="tr">with probing spear. Yet did the multitude</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="card"/>Then from the citadel, conspicuous,</p>
<p n="tr">Laocoon, with all his following choir,</p>

<p n="tr">What madness this? Who deems our foemen fled?</p>
<p n="tr">Think ye the gifts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> can lack for guile?</p>

<p n="tr">So saying, he whirled with ponderous javelin</p>

<p n="tr">its towering form, and through the cavernous womb</p>

<p n="tr">If heaven's decree, if our own wills, that hour,</p>

<p n="tr">although a nameless stranger, cunningly</p>
<p n="tr">deliver to the Greek the gates of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p>
<p n="tr">His firm-set mind flinched not from either goal,</p>

<p n="tr">The thronging Trojan youth made haste his way</p>
<p n="tr">from every side, all eager to see close</p>
<p n="tr">their captive's face, and clout with emulous scorn.</p>
<p n="tr">Hear now what Greek deception is, and learn</p>
<p n="tr">from one dark wickedness the whole. For he,</p>
<p n="tr">a mark for every eye, defenceless, dazed,</p>
<p n="tr">stood staring at our Phrygian hosts, and cried:</p>
<p n="tr">Woe worth the day! What ocean or what shore</p>

<p n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s furious sons call bloody vengeance down.</p>
<p n="tr">Such groans and anguish turned all rage away</p>
<p n="tr">and stayed our lifted hands. We bade him tell</p>
<p n="tr">his birth, his errand, and from whence might be</p>
<p n="tr">such hope of mercy for a foe in chains.</p>
<p n="tr">Then fearing us no more, this speech he dared:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="77" unit="card"/>O King! I will confess, whate'er befall,</p>
<p n="tr">the whole unvarnished truth. I will not hide</p>
<p n="tr">my Grecian birth. Yea, thus will I begin.</p>
<p n="tr">For Fortune has brought wretched Sinon low;</p>
<p n="tr">but never shall her cruelty impair</p>
<p n="tr">his honor and his truth. Perchance the name</p>
<p n="tr">of Palamedes, Belus' glorious son,</p>
<p n="tr">has come by rumor to your listening ears;</p>
<p n="tr">whom by false witness and conspiracy,</p>
<p n="tr">because his counsel was not for this war,</p>
<p n="tr">the Greeks condemned, though guiltless, to his death,</p>
<p n="tr">and now make much lament for him they slew.</p>
<p n="tr">I, his companion, of his kith and kin,</p>
<p n="tr">sent hither by my humble sire's command,</p>
<p n="tr">followed his arms and fortunes from my youth.</p>
<p n="tr">Long as his throne endured, and while he throve</p>

<p n="tr">because that cheat Ulysses envied him</p>
<p n="tr">(Ye know the deed), he from this world withdrew,</p>
<p n="tr">and I in gloom and tribulation sore</p>
<p n="tr">lived miserably on, lamenting loud</p>
<p n="tr">my lost friend's blameless fall. A fool was I</p>
<p n="tr">that kept not these lips closed; but I had vowed</p>
<p n="tr">that if a conqueror home to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> I came,</p>
<p n="tr">I would avenge. Such words moved wrath, and were</p>
<p n="tr">the first shock of my ruin; from that hour,</p>
<p n="tr">Ulysses whispered slander and alarm;</p>
<p n="tr">breathed doubt and malice into all men's ears,</p>
<p n="tr">and darkly plotted how to strike his blow.</p>
<p n="tr">Nor rest had he, till Calchas, as his tool,-</p>

<p n="tr">Why make delay? Ye count all sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></p>

<p n="tr">Ulysses smiles and Atreus' royal sons</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="card"/>We ply him then with passionate appeal</p>
<p n="tr">and question all his cause: of guilt so dire</p>
<p n="tr">or such Greek guile we harbored not the thought.</p>
<p n="tr">So on he prates, with well-feigned grief and fear,</p>
<p n="tr">and from his Iying heart thus told his tale:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Full oft the Greeks had fain achieved their flight,</p>
<p n="tr">and raised the Trojan siege, and sailed away</p>
<p n="tr">war-wearied quite. O, would it had been so!</p>
<p n="tr">Full oft the wintry tumult of the seas</p>
<p n="tr">did wall them round, and many a swollen storm</p>
<p n="tr">their embarcation stayed. But chiefly when,</p>
<p n="tr">all fitly built of beams of maple fair,</p>
<p n="tr">this horse stood forth, what thunders filled the skies!</p>
<p n="tr">With anxious fears we sent Eurypylus</p>
<p n="tr">to ask Apollo's word; and from the shrine</p>
<p n="tr">he brings the sorrowful commandment home:</p>
<p n="tr">By flowing blood and by a virgin slain</p>
<p n="tr">the wild winds were appeased, when first ye came,</p>
<p n="tr">ye sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s distant shore.</p>
<p n="tr">Through blood ye must return. Let some Greek life</p>
<p n="tr">your expiation be. The popular ear</p>
<p n="tr">the saying caught, all spirits were dimmed o'er;</p>
<p n="tr">cold doubt and horror through each bosom ran,</p>
<p n="tr">asking what fate would do, and on what wretch</p>
<p n="tr">Apollo's choice would fall. Ulysses, then,</p>
<p n="tr">amid the people's tumult and acclaim,</p>
<p n="tr">thrust Calchas forth, some prophecy to tell</p>
<p n="tr">to all the throng: he asked him o'er and o'er</p>
<p n="tr">what Heaven desired. Already not a few</p>
<p n="tr">foretold the murderous plot, and silently</p>
<p n="tr">watched the dark doom upon my life impend.</p>
<p n="tr">Twice five long days the seer his lips did seal,</p>
<p n="tr">and hid himself, refusing to bring forth</p>
<p n="tr"> His word of guile, and name what wretch should die.</p>
<p n="tr">At last, reluctant, and all loudly urged</p>
<p n="tr"> By false Ulysses, he fulfils their plot,</p>
<p n="tr">and, lifting up his voice oracular,</p>
<p n="tr">points out myself the victim to be slain.</p>
<p n="tr">Nor did one voice oppose. The mortal stroke</p>
<p n="tr">horribly hanging o'er each coward head</p>
<p n="tr">was changed to one man's ruin, and their hearts</p>
<p n="tr">endured it well. Soon rose th' accursed morn;</p>
<p n="tr">the bloody ritual was ready; salt</p>
<p n="tr">was sprinkled on the sacred loaf; my brows</p>
<p n="tr">were bound with fillets for the offering.</p>
<p n="tr">But I escaped that deathyes! I deny not!</p>
<p n="tr">I cast my fetters off, and darkling lay</p>
<p n="tr">concealed all night in lake-side sedge and mire,</p>
<p n="tr">awaiting their departure, if perchance</p>
<p n="tr">they should in truth set sail. But nevermore</p>
<p n="tr">shall my dear, native country greet these eyes.</p>
<p n="tr">No more my father or my tender babes</p>
<p n="tr">shall I behold. Nay, haply their own lives</p>
<p n="tr">are forfeit, when my foemen take revenge</p>
<p n="tr">for my escape, and slay those helpless ones,</p>
<p n="tr">in expiation of my guilty deed.</p>
<p n="tr">O, by yon powers in heaven which witness truth,</p>
<p n="tr">by aught in this dark world remaining now</p>
<p n="tr">of spotless human faith and innocence,</p>
<p n="tr">I do implore thee look with pitying eye</p>
<p n="tr">on these long sufferings my heart hath borne.</p>
<p n="tr">O, pity! I deserve not what I bear.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="card"/>Pity and pardon to his tears we gave,</p>
<p n="tr">and spared his life. King Priam bade unbind</p>
<p n="tr">the fettered hands and loose those heavy chains</p>
<p n="tr">that pressed him sore; then with benignant mien</p>
<p n="tr">addressed him thus:  Whate'er thy place or name,</p>
<p n="tr">forget the people thou hast Iost, and be</p>
<p n="tr">henceforth our countryman. But tell me true!</p>
<p n="tr">What means the monstrous fabric of this horse?</p>
<p n="tr">Who made it? Why? What offering to Heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">or engin'ry of conquest may it be?</p>
<p n="tr">He spake; and in reply, with skilful guile,</p>
<p n="tr">Greek that he was! the other lifted up</p>
<p n="tr">his hands, now freed and chainless, to the skies:</p>
<p n="tr">O ever-burning and inviolate fires,</p>
<p n="tr">witness my word! O altars and sharp steel,</p>
<p n="tr">whose curse I fled, O fillets of the gods,</p>
<p n="tr">which bound a victim's helpless forehead, hear!</p>
<p n="tr">'T is lawful now to break the oath that gave</p>
<p n="tr">my troth to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. To execrate her kings</p>
<p n="tr">is now my solemn duty. Their whole plot</p>
<p n="tr">I publish to the world. No fatherland</p>
<p n="tr">and no allegiance binds me any more.</p>
<p n="tr">O Troy, whom I have saved, I bid thee keep</p>
<p n="tr">the pledge of safety by good Priam given,</p>
<p n="tr">for my true tale shall my rich ransom be.</p>
<p n="tr">The Greeks' one hope, since first they opened war,</p>
<p n="tr">was Pallas, grace and power. But from the day</p>
<p n="tr">when Diomed, bold scorner of the gods,</p>
<p n="tr">and false Ulysses, author of all guile,</p>
<p n="tr">rose up and violently bore away</p>
<p n="tr">Palladium, her holy shrine, hewed down</p>
<p n="tr">the sentinels of her acropolis,</p>
<p n="tr">and with polluted, gory hands dared touch</p>
<p n="tr">the goddess, virgin fillets, white and pure,</p>
<p n="tr">thenceforth, I say, the courage of the Greeks</p>
<p n="tr">ebbed utterly away; their strength was Iost,</p>
<p n="tr">and favoring Pallas all her grace withdrew.</p>
<p n="tr">No dubious sign she gave. Scarce had they set</p>
<p n="tr">her statue in our camp, when glittering flame</p>
<p n="tr">flashed from the staring eyes; from all its limbs</p>
<p n="tr">salt sweat ran forth; three times (O wondrous tale!)</p>
<p n="tr">it gave a sudden skyward leap, and made</p>
<p n="tr">prodigious trembling of her lance and shield.</p>
<p n="tr">The prophet Calchas bade us straightway take</p>
<p n="tr">swift flight across the sea; for fate had willed</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan citadel should never fall</p>
<p n="tr">by Grecian arm, till once more they obtain</p>
<p n="tr">new oracles at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and restore</p>
<p n="tr">that god the round ships hurried o'er the sea.</p>
<p n="tr">Now in <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, whither they are fled,</p>
<p n="tr">new help of heaven they find, and forge anew</p>
<p n="tr">the means of war. Back hither o'er the waves</p>
<p n="tr">they suddenly will come. So Calchas gave</p>
<p n="tr">the meaning of the god. Warned thus, they reared</p>
<p n="tr">in place of Pallas, desecrated shrine</p>
<p n="tr">yon image of the horse, to expiate</p>
<p n="tr">the woeful sacrilege. Calchas ordained</p>
<p n="tr">that they should build a thing of monstrous size</p>
<p n="tr">of jointed beams, and rear it heavenward,</p>
<p n="tr">so might it never pass your gates, nor come</p>
<p n="tr">inside your walls, nor anywise restore</p>
<p n="tr">unto the Trojans their lost help divine.</p>
<p n="tr">For had your hands Minerva's gift profaned,</p>

<p n="tr">would hurl aggression upon Pelops' land,</p>
<p n="tr">and all that curse on our own nation fall.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="card"/>Thus Sinon's guile and practiced perjury</p>
<p n="tr">our doubt dispelled. His stratagems and tears</p>
<p n="tr">wrought victory where neither Tydeus' son,</p>
<p n="tr">nor mountain-bred Achilles could prevail,</p>
<p n="tr">nor ten years' war, nor fleets a thousand strong.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But now a vaster spectacle of fear</p>
<p n="tr">burst over us, to vex our startled souls.</p>
<p n="tr">Laocoon, that day by cast of lot</p>
<p n="tr">priest unto Neptune, was in act to slay</p>
<p n="tr">a huge bull at the god's appointed fane.</p>
<p n="tr">Lo! o'er the tranquil deep from Tenedos</p>
<p n="tr">appeared a pair (I shudder as I tell)</p>
<p n="tr">of vastly coiling serpents, side by side,</p>
<p n="tr">stretching along the waves, and to the shore</p>
<p n="tr">taking swift course; their necks were lifted high,</p>
<p n="tr">their gory dragon-crests o'ertopped the waves;</p>
<p n="tr">all else, half seen, trailed low along the sea;</p>
<p n="tr">while with loud cleavage of the foaming brine</p>
<p n="tr">their monstrous backs wound forward fold on fold.</p>
<p n="tr">Soon they made land; the furious bright eyes</p>
<p n="tr">glowed with ensanguined fire; their quivering tongues</p>
<p n="tr">lapped hungrily the hissing, gruesome jaws.</p>
<p n="tr">All terror-pale we fled. Unswerving then</p>
<p n="tr">the monsters to Laocoon made way.</p>
<p n="tr">First round the tender limbs of his two sons</p>
<p n="tr">each dragon coiled, and on the shrinking flesh</p>
<p n="tr">fixed fast and fed. Then seized they on the sire,</p>
<p n="tr">who flew to aid, a javelin in his hand,</p>
<p n="tr">embracing close in bondage serpentine</p>
<p n="tr">twice round the waist; and twice in scaly grasp</p>
<p n="tr">around his neck, and o'er him grimly peered</p>
<p n="tr">with lifted head and crest; he, all the while,</p>
<p n="tr">his holy fillet fouled with venomous blood,</p>
<p n="tr">tore at his fetters with a desperate hand,</p>
<p n="tr">and lifted up such agonizing voice,</p>
<p n="tr">as when a bull, death-wounded, seeks to flee</p>
<p n="tr">the sacrificial altar, and thrusts back</p>
<p n="tr">from his doomed head the ill-aimed, glancing blade.</p>
<p n="tr">then swiftly writhed the dragon-pair away</p>
<p n="tr">unto the templed height, and in the shrine</p>
<p n="tr">of cruel Pallas sure asylum found</p>
<p n="tr">beneath the goddess' feet and orbed shield.</p>
<p n="tr">Such trembling horror as we ne'er had known</p>
<p n="tr">seized now on every heart.  Of his vast guilt</p>
<p n="tr">Laocoon, they say, receives reward;</p>
<p n="tr">for he with most abominable spear</p>
<p n="tr">did strike and violate that blessed wood.</p>

<p n="tr">Silent he stood, nor anywise would stay</p>
<p n="tr">my vain lament; but groaned, and answered thus:</p>

<p n="tr">He spoke: and from our holy hearth brought forth</p>

<p n="tr">I woke on sudden, and up-starting scaled</p>

<p n="tr">Others bear off the captives and the spoil</p>

<p n="tr">He spoke; but straightway, when no safe reply</p>
<p n="tr">returned, he knew himself entrapped, and fallen</p>
<p n="tr">into a foeman's snare; struck dumb was he</p>
<p n="tr">and stopped both word and motion; as one steps,</p>
<p n="tr">when blindly treading a thick path of thorns,</p>

<p n="tr">that lifted wrath and swollen gorge of green:</p>
<p n="tr">so trembling did Androgeos backward fall.</p>
<p n="tr">At them we flew and closed them round with war;</p>
<p n="tr">and since they could not know the ground, and fear </p>
<p n="tr">had whelmed them quite, we swiftly laid them low.</p>
<p n="tr">Thus Fortune on our first achievement smiled;</p>
<p n="tr">and, flushed with victory, Cormbus cried:</p>

<p n="tr">Now intermingled with our foes we moved,</p>
<p n="tr">and alien emblems wore; the long, black night</p>

<p n="tr">down to the dark we hurled. Some fled away,</p>
<p n="tr">seeking their safe ships and the friendly shore.</p>
<p n="tr">Some cowards foul went clambering back again</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="402" unit="card"/>But woe is me! If gods their help withhold,</p>

<p n="tr">the fair Cassandra passed us, bound in chains,</p>
<p n="tr">King Priam's virgin daughter, from the shrine</p>
<p n="tr">and altars of Minerva; her loose hair</p>
<p n="tr">had lost its fillet; her impassioned eyes</p>

<p n="tr">For chains of steel her frail, soft hands confined.</p>

<p n="tr">But, at this point, the overwhelming spears</p>

<p n="tr">from a high temple-tower; and carnage wild</p>
<p n="tr">ensued, because of the Greek arms we bore</p>
<p n="tr">and our false crests. The howling Grecian band,</p>
<p n="tr">crazed by Cassandra's rescue, charged at us</p>
<p n="tr">from every side; Ajax of savage soul,</p>
<p n="tr">the sons of Atreus, and that whole wild horde</p>
<p n="tr">Achilles from Dolopian deserts drew.</p>

<p n="tr">and foam-flecked Nereus with fierce trident stirs</p>
<p n="tr">the dark deep of the sea. All who did hide</p>

<p n="tr">surprised, and driven in tumultuous flight,</p>
<p n="tr">now start to view. Full well they now can see</p>
<p n="tr">our shields and borrowed arms, and clearly note</p>
<p n="tr">our speech of alien sound; their multitude</p>
<p n="tr">o'erwhelms us utterly. Coroebus first</p>
<p n="tr">at mailed Minerva's altar prostrate lay,</p>
<p n="tr">pierced by Peneleus, blade; then Rhipeus fell;</p>
<p n="tr">we deemed him of all Trojans the most just, </p>
<p n="tr">most scrupulously righteous; but the gods</p>
<p n="tr">gave judgment otherwise. There Dymas died,</p>
<p n="tr">and Hypanis, by their compatriots slain;</p>
<p n="tr">nor thee, O Panthus, in that mortal hour,</p>

<p n="tr">O ashes of my country! funeral pyre</p>

<p n="tr">deserved a warrior's death, had Fate ordained.</p>
<p n="tr">But soon our ranks were broken; at my side</p>
<p n="tr">stayed Iphitus and Pelias; one with age</p>
<p n="tr">was Iong since wearied, and the other bore</p>
<p n="tr">the burden of Ulysses' crippling wound.</p>
<p n="tr">Straightway the roar and tumult summoned us</p>
<p n="tr">to Priam's palace,<milestone ed="p" n="438" unit="card"/>where a battle raged</p>
<p n="tr">as if save this no conflict else were known,</p>

<p n="tr">There we beheld the war-god unconfined;</p>
<p n="tr">The Greek besiegers to the roof-tops fled;</p>
<p n="tr">or, with shields tortoise-back, the gates assailed.</p>
<p n="tr">Ladders were on the walls; and round by round,</p>

<p n="tr">the right to every vantage closely clings.</p>
<p n="tr">The Trojans hurl whole towers and roof-tops down</p>
<p n="tr">upon the mounting foe; for well they see</p>
<p n="tr">that the last hour is come, and with what arms</p>
<p n="tr">the dying must resist. Rich gilded beams,</p>
<p n="tr">with many a beauteous blazon of old time,</p>

<p n="tr">defend the inner doors in close array.</p>

<p n="tr">for the king's house, and to his body-guard</p>

<p n="tr">A certain gate I knew, a secret way,</p>
<p n="tr">which gave free passage between Priam's halls,</p>
<p n="tr">and exit rearward; hither, in the days</p>
<p n="tr">before our fall, the lone Andromache</p>
<p n="tr">was wont with young Astyanax to pass</p>
<p n="tr">in quest of Priam and her husband's kin.</p>
<p n="tr">This way to climb the palace roof I flew,</p>
<p n="tr">where, desperate, the Trojans with vain skill</p>
<p n="tr">hurled forth repellent arms. A tower was there,</p>
<p n="tr">reared skyward from the roof-top, giving view</p>

<p n="tr">of all <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName>'s fleets and tented field;</p>
<p n="tr">this, with strong steel, our gathered strength assailed,</p>
<p n="tr">and as the loosened courses offered us</p>

<p n="tr">from its aerial throne and thrust it down.</p>
<p n="tr">It fell with instantaneous crash of thunder</p>
<p n="tr">along the Danaan host in ruin wide.</p>
<p n="tr">But fresh ranks soon arrive; thick showers of stone</p>
<p n="tr">rain down, with every missile rage can find.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="469" unit="card"/>Now at the threshold of the outer court </p>
<p n="tr">Pyrrhus triumphant stood, with glittering arms</p>
<p n="tr">and helm of burnished brass. He glittered like</p>
<p n="tr">some swollen viper, fed on poison-leaves,</p>
<p n="tr">whom chilling winter shelters underground,</p>
<p n="tr">till, fresh and strong, he sheds his annual scales</p>
<p n="tr">and, crawling forth rejuvenate, uncoils</p>
<p n="tr">his slimy length; his lifted gorge insults</p>
<p n="tr">the sunbeam with three-forked and quivering tongue.</p>
<p n="tr">Huge Periphas was there; Automedon,</p>
<p n="tr">who drove Achilles' steeds, and bore his arms.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Scyros' island-warriors assault</p>
<p n="tr">the palaces, and hurl reiterate fire</p>
<p n="tr">at wall and tower. Pyrrhus led the van;</p>
<p n="tr">seizing an axe he clove the ponderous doors</p>
<p n="tr">and rent the hinges from their posts of bronze;</p>
<p n="tr">he cut the beams, and through the solid mass</p>
<p n="tr">burrowed his way, till like a window huge</p>
<p n="tr">the breach yawned wide, and opened to his gaze</p>
<p n="tr">a vista of long courts and corridors,</p>
<p n="tr">the hearth and home of many an ancient king,</p>
<p n="tr">and Priam's own; upon its sacred bourne</p>
<p n="tr">the sentry, all in arms, kept watch and ward.</p>
<p n="tr">Confusion, groans, and piteous turmoil</p>
<p n="tr">were in that dwelling; women shrieked and wailed</p>
<p n="tr">from many a dark retreat, and their loud cry</p>
<p n="tr">rang to the golden stars. Through those vast halls</p>
<p n="tr">the panic-stricken mothers wildly roved,</p>
<p n="tr">and clung with frantic kisses and embrace</p>
<p n="tr">unto the columns cold. Fierce as his sire,</p>
<p n="tr">Pyrrhus moves on; nor bar nor sentinel</p>
<p n="tr">may stop his way; down tumbles the great door</p>
<p n="tr">beneath the battering beam, and with it fall</p>
<p n="tr">hinges and framework violently torn.</p>
<p n="tr">Force bursts all bars; th' assailing Greeks break in,</p>
<p n="tr">do butchery, and with men-at-arms possess</p>
<p n="tr">what place they will. Scarce with an equal rage</p>
<p n="tr">a foaming river, when its dykes are down,</p>
<p n="tr">o'erwhelms its mounded shores, and through the plain</p>
<p n="tr">rolls mountain-high, while from the ravaged farms</p>
<p n="tr">its fierce flood sweeps along both flock and fold.</p>
<p n="tr">My own eyes looked on Neoptolemus</p>
<p n="tr">frenzied with slaughter, and both Atreus' sons</p>

<p n="tr">the altars where himself had blessed the fires;</p>
<p n="tr">there fifty nuptial beds gave promise proud</p>
<p n="tr">of princely heirs; but all their brightness now,</p>
<p n="tr">of broidered cunning and barbaric gold,</p>
<p n="tr">lay strewn and trampled on. The Danaan foe</p>
<p n="tr">stood victor, where the raging flame had failed.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="506" unit="card"/>But would ye haply know what stroke of doom</p>
<p n="tr">on Priam fell? Now when his anguish saw</p>
<p n="tr">his kingdom lost and fallen, his abode</p>
<p n="tr">shattered, and in his very hearth and home</p>
<p n="tr">th' exulting foe, the aged King did bind</p>
<p n="tr">his rusted armor to his trembling thews,</p>
<p n="tr">all vainly, and a useless blade of steel</p>
<p n="tr">he girded on; then charged, resolved to die</p>
<p n="tr">encircled by the foe. Within his walls</p>
<p n="tr">there stood, beneath the wide and open sky,</p>
<p n="tr">a lofty altar; an old laurel-tree</p>
<p n="tr">leaned o'er it, and enclasped in holy shade</p>
<p n="tr">the statues of the tutelary powers.</p>
<p n="tr">Here Hecuba and all the princesses</p>
<p n="tr">took refuge vain within the place of prayer.</p>
<p n="tr">Like panic-stricken doves in some dark storm,</p>
<p n="tr">close-gathering they sate, and in despair</p>
<p n="tr">embraced their graven gods. But when the Queen</p>
<p n="tr">saw Priam with his youthful harness on, </p>
<p n="tr">What frenzy, O my wretched lord, she cried,</p>
<p n="tr">Arrayed thee in such arms? O, whither now?</p>
<p n="tr">Not such defences, nor such arm as thine,</p>
<p n="tr">the time requires, though thy companion were</p>
<p n="tr">our Hector's self. O, yield thee, I implore!</p>
<p n="tr">This altar now shall save us one and all,</p>
<p n="tr">or we must die together. With these words</p>
<p n="tr">she drew him to her side, and near the shrine</p>
<p n="tr">made for her aged spouse a place to cling.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="526" unit="card"/>But, lo! just 'scaped of Pyrrhus' murderous hand,</p>
<p n="tr">Polites, one of Priam's sons, fled fast</p>
<p n="tr">along the corridors, through thronging foes</p>
<p n="tr">and a thick rain of spears. Wildly he gazed</p>
<p n="tr">across the desolate halls, wounded to death.</p>
<p n="tr">Fierce Pyrrhus followed after, pressing hard</p>
<p n="tr">with mortal stroke, and now his hand and spear</p>
<p n="tr">were close upon: when the lost youth leaped forth</p>
<p n="tr">into his father's sight, and prostrate there</p>
<p n="tr">lay dying, while his life-blood ebbed away.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Priam, though on all sides death was nigh,</p>
<p n="tr">quit not the strife, nor from loud wrath refrained:</p>
<p n="tr">Thy crime and impious outrage, may the gods</p>
<p n="tr">(if Heaven to mortals render debt and due)</p>
<p n="tr">justly reward and worthy honors pay!</p>
<p n="tr">My own son's murder thou hast made me see,</p>
<p n="tr">blood and pollution impiously throwing</p>
<p n="tr">upon a father's head. Not such was he,</p>
<p n="tr">not such, Achilles, thy pretended sire,</p>
<p n="tr">when Priam was his foe. With flush of shame</p>
<p n="tr">he nobly listened to a suppliant's plea</p>
<p n="tr">in honor made. He rendered to the tomb</p>
<p n="tr">my Hector's body pale, and me did send</p>
<p n="tr">back to my throne a king. With this proud word</p>
<p n="tr">the aged warrior hurled with nerveless arm</p>
<p n="tr">his ineffectual spear, which hoarsely rang</p>
<p n="tr">rebounding on the brazen shield, and hung</p>
<p n="tr">piercing the midmost boss,- but all in vain.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Pyrrhus: Take these tidings, and convey</p>
<p n="tr">message to my father, Peleus' son!</p>
<p n="tr">tell him my naughty deeds! Be sure and say</p>
<p n="tr">how Neoptolemus hath shamed his sires.</p>
<p n="tr">Now die! With this, he trailed before the shrines</p>
<p n="tr">the trembling King, whose feet slipped in the stream</p>
<p n="tr">of his son's blood. Then Pyrrhus' left hand clutched</p>
<p n="tr">the tresses old and gray; a glittering sword</p>
<p n="tr">his right hand lifted high, and buried it</p>
<p n="tr">far as the hilt in that defenceless heart.</p>
<p n="tr">So Priam's story ceased. Such final doom</p>

<p n="tr">the foul bark oozed with clots of blackest gore!</p>
<p n="tr">From my deep-shaken soul I made a prayer</p>
<p n="tr">to all the woodland nymphs and to divine</p>
<p n="tr">Gradivus, patron of the Thracian plain,</p>
<p n="tr">to bless this sight, to lift its curse away.</p>
<p n="tr">But when at a third sheaf of myrtle spears</p>
<p n="tr">I fell upon my knees, and tugged amain</p>
<p n="tr">against the adverse ground (I dread to tell!),</p>
<p n="tr">a moaning and a wail from that deep grave</p>
<p n="tr">burst forth and murmured in my listening ear:</p>
<p n="tr">Why wound me, great Aeneas, in my woe?</p>
<p n="tr">O, spare the dead, nor let thy holy hands</p>
<p n="tr">do sacrilege and sin! I, Trojan-born,</p>
<p n="tr">was kin of thine. This blood is not of trees.</p>
<p n="tr">Haste from this murderous shore, this land of greed.</p>
<p n="tr">O, I am Polydorus! Haste away!</p>
<p n="tr">Here was I pierced; a crop of iron spears </p>
<p n="tr">has grown up o'er my breast, and multiplied </p>
<p n="tr">to all these deadly javelins, keen and strong.</p>
<p n="tr">Then stood I, burdened with dark doubt and fear</p>
<p n="tr">I quailed, my hair rose and my utterance choked.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="49" unit="card"/>For once this Polydorus, with much gold,</p>

<p n="tr">were ringed about by unrelenting siege.</p>
<p n="tr">That king, when <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s cause was ebbing low,</p>

<p n="tr">built a perpetual altar, sadly dressed</p>
<p n="tr">in cypress dark and purple pall of woe.</p>
<p n="tr">Our Ilian women wailed with loosened hair;</p>
<p n="tr">new milk was sprinkled from a foaming cup,</p>
<p n="tr">and from the shallow bowl fresh blood out-poured</p>
<p n="tr">upon the sacred ground. So in its tomb</p>
<p n="tr">we laid his ghost to rest, and loudly sang,</p>

<p n="tr">There is a sacred island in mid-seas,</p>

<p n="tr">Prostrate to earth we fall, as on our ears</p>

<p n="tr">So Phoebus spoke; and mighty joy uprose</p>

<p n="tr">if Jove but bless, the third day's dawn should see</p>
<p n="tr">our ships at Cretan land. So, having said,</p>
<p n="tr">he slew the victims for each altar's praise.</p>
<p n="tr">A bull to Neptune, and a bull to thee,</p>
<p n="tr">o beauteous Apollo! A black lamb</p>

<p n="tr">Freely behind us blew the friendly winds, </p>

<p n="tr">There eagerly I labored at the walls</p>

<p n="tr">bathed in bright beams which from the moon at full</p>

<p n="tr">the hard, long labors of an exile's way.</p>
<p n="tr">Change this abode! Not thine this Cretan shore,</p>

<p n="tr">There is a land the roving Greeks have named</p>
<p n="tr">Hesperia. It is a storied realm</p>
<p n="tr">made mighty by great wars and fruitful land.</p>
<p n="tr">Oenotrians had it, and their sons, 't is said,</p>
<p n="tr">have called it <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, a chieftain's name</p>
<p n="tr">to a whole region given. That land alone</p>
<p n="tr">our true abode can be; for Dardanus</p>

<p n="tr">Ausonia seek and Corythus; for Jove</p>

<p n="tr">I marvelled at the heavenly presences</p>
<p n="tr">so vocal and so bright, for 't was not sleep;</p>
<p n="tr">but face to face I deemed I could discern</p>
<p n="tr">each countenance august and holy brow,</p>
<p n="tr">each mantled head; and from my body ran</p>
<p n="tr">cold sweat of awe. From my low couch I sprang,</p>
<p n="tr">lifting to heaven my suppliant hands and prayer,</p>
<p n="tr">and o'er my hearth poured forth libations free.</p>
<p n="tr">After th' auspicious offering, I told</p>

<p n="tr">He owned our stock two-branched, of our great sires</p>

<p n="tr">then spoke: O son, in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s doom severe</p>
<p n="tr">afflicted ever! To my ears alone</p>

<p n="tr">Hesperia! oft <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>'s kingdom! called.</p>
<p n="tr">But who had faith that Teucer's sons should come</p>
<p n="tr">to far Hesperia? What mortal ear</p>
<p n="tr">gave heed to sad Cassandra's voice divine?</p>
<p n="tr">Now Phoebus speaks. Obedient let us be,</p>
<p n="tr">and, warned by him, our happier Iot pursue!</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke: with heart of hope we all obeyed;</p>
<p n="tr">again we changed abode; and, leaving there</p>
<p n="tr">a feeble few, again with spreading sails</p>
<p n="tr">we coursed in hollow ship the spacious sea.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="192" unit="card"/>When from the deep the shores had faded far,</p>
<p n="tr">and only sky and sea were round our way,</p>
<p n="tr">full in the zenith hung a purple cloud,</p>
<p n="tr">storm-laden, dark as night, and every wave</p>
<p n="tr">grew black and angry, while perpetual gales</p>
<p n="tr">came rolling o'er the main, and mountain-high</p>
<p n="tr">the wreckful surges rose; our ships were hurled</p>
<p n="tr">wide o'er the whirling waters; thunder-clouds</p>
<p n="tr">and misty murk of night made end of all</p>
<p n="tr">the light of heaven, save where the rifted storm</p>
<p n="tr">flashed with the oft-reiterate shaft of Jove.</p>
<p n="tr">Then went we drifting, beaten from our course,</p>
<p n="tr">upon a trackless sea. Not even the eyes</p>
<p n="tr">of Palinurus could tell night from noon</p>
<p n="tr">or ken our way. Three days of blinding dark,</p>
<p n="tr">three nights without a star, we roved the seas;</p>
<p n="tr">The fourth, land seemed to rise. Far distant hills</p>
<p n="tr">and rolling smoke we saw. Down came our sails,</p>
<p n="tr">out flew the oars, and with prompt stroke the crews</p>
<p n="tr">swept the dark waves and tossed the crested foam.</p>
<p n="tr">From such sea-peril safe, I made the shores</p>
<p n="tr">of Strophades,a name the Grecians gave</p>
<p n="tr">to islands in the broad Ionic main, </p>
<p n="tr">the Strophades, where dread Celaeno bides,</p>
<p n="tr">with other Harpies, who had quit the halls</p>
<p n="tr">of stricken Phineus, and for very fear</p>
<p n="tr">fled from the routed feast; no prodigy</p>
<p n="tr">more vile than these, nor plague more pitiless</p>
<p n="tr">ere rose by wrath divine from Stygian wave;</p>
<p n="tr">birds seem they, but with face like woman-kind;</p>
<p n="tr">foul-flowing bellies, hands with crooked claws,</p>
<p n="tr">and ghastly lips they have, with hunger pale.</p>
<p n="tr">Scarce had we made the haven, when, behold!</p>
<p n="tr">Fair herds of cattle roaming a wide plain,</p>
<p n="tr">and horned goats, untended, feeding free</p>
<p n="tr">in pastures green, surprised our happy eyes.</p>
<p n="tr">with eager blades we ran to take and slay,</p>
<p n="tr">asking of every god, and chicfly Jove,</p>
<p n="tr">to share the welcome prize: we ranged a feast,</p>
<p n="tr">with turf-built couches and a banquet-board</p>
<p n="tr">along the curving strand. But in a trice,</p>
<p n="tr">down from the high hills swooping horribly,</p>
<p n="tr">the Harpies loudly shrieking, flapped their wings,</p>
<p n="tr">snatched at our meats, and with infectious touch</p>
<p n="tr">polluted all; infernal was their cry,</p>
<p n="tr">the stench most vile. Once more in covert far</p>
<p n="tr">beneath a caverned rock, and close concealed</p>
<p n="tr">with trees and branching shade, we raised aloft</p>
<p n="tr">our tables, altars, and rekindled fires.</p>
<p n="tr">Once more from haunts unknown the clamorous flock</p>
<p n="tr">from every quarter flew, and seized its prey</p>
<p n="tr">with taloned feet and carrion lip most foul.</p>
<p n="tr">I called my mates to arms and opened war</p>
<p n="tr">on that accursed brood. My band obeyed;</p>
<p n="tr">and, hiding in deep grass their swords and shields,</p>
<p n="tr">in ambush lay. But presently the foe</p>
<p n="tr">swept o'er the winding shore with loud alarm :</p>
<p n="tr">then from a sentry-crag, Misenus blew</p>
<p n="tr">a signal on his hollow horn. My men</p>
<p n="tr">flew to the combat strange, and fain would wound</p>
<p n="tr">with martial steel those foul birds of the sea;</p>
<p n="tr">but on their sides no wounding blade could fall,</p>
<p n="tr">nor any plume be marred. In swiftest flight</p>
<p n="tr">to starry skies they soared, and left on earth</p>
<p n="tr">their half-gnawed, stolen feast, and footprints foul.</p>
<p n="tr">Celaeno only on a beetling crag</p>
<p n="tr">took lofty perch, and, prophetess of ill,</p>
<p n="tr">shrieked malediction from her vulture breast:</p>
<p n="tr">Because of slaughtered kine and ravished herd,</p>
<p n="tr">sons of Laomedon, have ye made war?</p>
<p n="tr">And will ye from their rightful kingdom drive</p>
<p n="tr">the guiltless Harpies? Hear, O, hear my word</p>
<p n="tr">(Long in your bosoms may it rankle sore!)</p>

<p n="tr">But never shall ye rear the circling walls</p>
<p n="tr">of your own city, till for this our blood</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="258" unit="card"/>She spoke: her pinions bore her to the grove,</p>
<p n="tr">and she was seen no more. But all my band</p>
<p n="tr">shuddered with shock of fear in each cold vein;</p>
<p n="tr">their drooping spirits trusted swords no more,</p>
<p n="tr">but turned to prayers and offerings, asking grace,</p>
<p n="tr">scarce knowing if those creatures were divine,</p>
<p n="tr">or but vast birds, ill-omened and unclean.</p>
<p n="tr">Father Anchises to the gods in heaven</p>
<p n="tr">uplifted suppliant hands, and on that shore</p>
<p n="tr">due ritual made, crying aloud; Ye gods</p>
<p n="tr">avert this curse, this evil turn away!</p>
<p n="tr">Smile, Heaven, upon your faithful votaries.</p>
<p n="tr">Then bade he launch away, the chain undo,</p>
<p n="tr">set every cable free and spread all sail.</p>
<p n="tr">O'er the white waves we flew, and took our way</p>
<p n="tr">where'er the helmsman or the winds could guide.</p>
<p n="tr">Now forest-clad <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName> met our gaze,</p>

<p n="tr">the Queen of Pyrrhus, great Achilles' son,</p>
<p n="tr">and gained his throne; and that Andromache</p>

<p n="tr">Amazement held me; all my bosom burned</p>
<p n="tr">to see the hero's face and hear this tale</p>
<p n="tr">of strange vicissitude. So up I climbed,</p>
<p n="tr">leaving the haven, fleet, and friendly shore.</p>
<p n="tr">That self-same hour outside the city walls,</p>
<p n="tr">within a grove where flowed the mimic stream</p>
<p n="tr">of a new Simois, Andromache,</p>
<p n="tr">with offerings to the dead, and gifts of woe,</p>
<p n="tr">poured forth libation, and invoked the shade</p>
<p n="tr">of Hector, at a tomb which her fond grief</p>
<p n="tr">had consecrated to perpetual tears,</p>

<p n="tr">Of truth, O goddess-born? Art still in flesh?</p>
<p n="tr">Or if sweet light be fled, my Hector, where?</p>
<p n="tr">With flood of tears she spoke, and all the grove</p>

<p n="tr">brief answer to her passion, but replied</p>
<p n="tr">with broken voice and accents faltering:</p>
<p n="tr">I live, 't is true. I lengthen out my days</p>

<p n="tr">that what thine eyes behold is vision true.</p>
<p n="tr">Alas! what lot is thine, that wert unthroned</p>
<p n="tr">from such a husband's side? What after-fate</p>

<p n="tr">in sight of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>, on a foeman's tomb!</p>
<p n="tr">No casting of the lot her doom decreed,</p>

<p n="tr">Myself from burning <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName> carried far</p>
<p n="tr">o'er seas and seas, endured the swollen pride</p>
<p n="tr">of that young scion of Achilles' race,</p>
<p n="tr">and bore him as his slave a son. When he</p>
<p n="tr">sued for Hermione, of Leda's line,</p>
<p n="tr">and nuptial-bond with Lacedaemon's Iords,</p>
<p n="tr">I, the slave-wife, to Helenus was given,</p>
<p n="tr">and slave was wed with slave. But afterward</p>
<p n="tr">Orestes, crazed by loss of her he loved,</p>
<p n="tr">and ever fury-driven from crime to crime,</p>
<p n="tr">crept upon Pyrrhus in a careless hour</p>
<p n="tr">and murdered him upon his own hearth-stone.</p>
<p n="tr">Part of the realm of Neoptolemus</p>
<p n="tr">fell thus to Helenus, who called his lands</p>
<p n="tr">Chaonian, and in Trojan Chaon's name</p>
<p n="tr">his kingdom is Chaonia. Yonder height</p>
<p n="tr">is <placeName key="perseus,Pergamon">Pergamus</placeName>, our Ilian citadel.</p>
<p n="tr">What power divine did waft thee to our shore,</p>

<p n="tr">Thus poured she forth full many a doleful word</p>
<p n="tr">with unavailing tears. But as she ceased,</p>
<p n="tr">out of the city gates appeared the son</p>
<p n="tr">of Priam, Helenus, with princely train.</p>
<p n="tr">He welcomed us as kin, and glad at heart</p>
<p n="tr">gave guidance to his house, though oft his words</p>
<p n="tr">fell faltering and few, with many a tear.</p>
<p n="tr">Soon to a humbler <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> I lift my eyes,</p>

<p n="tr">the towering semblance; there a scanty stream</p>

<p n="tr">the pillars of a Scaean gate embrace.</p>
<p n="tr">My Teucrian mariners with welcome free</p>
<p n="tr">enjoyed the friendly town; his ample halls</p>
<p n="tr">our royal host threw wide; full wine-cups flowed</p>

<p n="tr">Who knowest Phoebus' power, and readest well</p>
<p n="tr">the tripod, stars, and vocal laurel leaves</p>
<p n="tr">to Phoebus dear, who know'st of every bird</p>
<p n="tr">the ominous swift wing or boding song,</p>
<p n="tr">o, speak! For all my course good omens showed,</p>
<p n="tr">and every god admonished me to sail</p>
<p n="tr">in quest of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>'s far-distant shores;</p>
<p n="tr">but lone Celaeno, heralding strange woe,</p>

<p n="tr">and vile, unnatural hunger. How elude</p>
<p n="tr">such perils? Or by what hard duty done</p>
<p n="tr">may such huge host of evils vanquished be?</p>
<p n="tr">Then Helenus, with sacrifice of kine</p>
<p n="tr">in order due, implored the grace of Heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">unloosed the fillets from his sacred brow,</p>
<p n="tr">and led me, Phoebus, to thy temple's door,</p>
<p n="tr">awed by th' o'er-brooding godhead, whose true priest,</p>
<p n="tr">with lips inspired, made this prophetic song:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="374" unit="card"/>O goddess-born, indubitably shines</p>
<p n="tr">the blessing of great gods upon thy path</p>

<p n="tr">the grand vicissitude, which now pursues</p>

<p n="tr">There is thy city's safe, predestined ground,</p>
<p n="tr">and there thy labors' end. Vex not thy heart</p>
<p n="tr">about those tables bitten, for kind fate</p>
<p n="tr">thy path will show, and Phoebus bless thy prayer.</p>
<p n="tr">But from these lands and yon Italian shore,</p>
<p n="tr">where from this sea of ours the tide sweeps in,</p>

<p n="tr">pernicious Greeks, thy foes: the <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName> there</p>

<p n="tr">Let all thy people keep this custom due,</p>

<p n="tr">she sets in order, and conceals them well</p>

<p n="tr">Likewise Andromache in mournful guise</p>

<p n="tr">it is my purpose now to consummate</p>
<p n="tr">the sacrifice ordained, ending my woe,</p>
<p n="tr">and touch with flame the Trojan's funeral pyre.</p>
<p n="tr">The aged crone to do her bidding ran</p>
<p n="tr">with trembling zeal. But Dido (horror-struck</p>
<p n="tr">at her own dread design, unstrung with fear,</p>
<p n="tr">her bloodshot eyes wide-rolling, and her cheek</p>
<p n="tr">twitching and fever-spotted, her cold brow</p>
<p n="tr">blanched with approaching death)sped past the doors</p>
<p n="tr">into the palace garden; there she leaped,</p>
<p n="tr">a frenzied creature, on the lofty pyre</p>
<p n="tr">and drew the Trojan's sword; a gift not asked</p>
<p n="tr">for use like this! When now she saw the garb</p>
<p n="tr">of Ilian fashion, and the nuptial couch</p>
<p n="tr">she knew too well, she lingered yet awhile</p>
<p n="tr">for memory and tears, and, falling prone</p>
<p n="tr">on that cold bed, outpoured a last farewell:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Sweet relics! Ever dear when Fate and Heaven</p>
<p n="tr">upon me smiled, receive my parting breath,</p>
<p n="tr">and from my woe set free! My life is done.</p>
<p n="tr">I have accomplished what my lot allowed;</p>
<p n="tr">and now my spirit to the world of death</p>
<p n="tr">in royal honor goes. The founder I</p>
<p n="tr">of yonder noble city, I have seen</p>
<p n="tr">walls at my bidding rise. I was avenged</p>
<p n="tr">for my slain husband: I chastised the crimes</p>
<p n="tr">of our injurious brother. Woe is me!</p>
<p n="tr">Blest had I been, beyond deserving blest, </p>
<p n="tr">if but the Trojan galleys ne'er had moored</p>
<p n="tr">upon my kingdom's bound!<milestone ed="p" n="659" unit="card"/>So saying, she pressed</p>
<p n="tr">one last kiss on the couch. Though for my death</p>
<p n="tr">no vengeance fall, O, give me death! she cried.</p>
<p n="tr">O thus! O thus! it is my will to take</p>
<p n="tr">the journey to the dark. From yonder sea</p>
<p n="tr">may his cold Trojan eyes discern the flames</p>
<p n="tr">that make me ashes! Be this cruel death</p>
<p n="tr">his omen as he sails! She spoke no more.</p>
<p n="tr">But almost ere she ceased, her maidens all</p>
<p n="tr">thronged to obey her cry, and found their Queen</p>
<p n="tr">prone fallen on the sword, the reeking steel</p>
<p n="tr">still in her bloody hands. Shrill clamor flew</p>
<p n="tr">along the lofty halls; wild rumor spread</p>
<p n="tr">through the whole smitten city: Ioud lament,</p>
<p n="tr">groans and the wail of women echoed on</p>
<p n="tr">from roof to roof, and to the dome of air</p>
<p n="tr">the noise of mourning rose. Such were the cry</p>
<p n="tr">if a besieging host should break the walls</p>
<p n="tr">of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> or old <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName>, and wrathful flames</p>
<p n="tr">o'er towers of kings and worshipped altars roll.</p>
<p n="tr">Her sister heard. Half in a swoon, she ran</p>
<p n="tr">with trembling steps, where thickest was the throng,</p>
<p n="tr">beating her breast, while with a desperate hand</p>
<p n="tr">she tore at her own face, and called aloud</p>
<p n="tr">upon the dying Queen. <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Was it for this</p>
<p n="tr">my own true sister used me with such guile?</p>
<p n="tr">O, was this horrid deed the dire intent</p>
<p n="tr">of altars, Iofty couch, and funeral fires?</p>
<p n="tr">What shall I tell for chiefest of my woes?</p>
<p n="tr">Lost that I am! Why, though in death, cast off</p>
<p n="tr">thy sister from thy heart? Why not invite</p>
<p n="tr">one mortal stroke for both, a single sword,</p>
<p n="tr">one agony together? But these hands</p>
<p n="tr">built up thy pyre; and my voice implored</p>
<p n="tr">the blessing of our gods, who granted me</p>
<p n="tr">that thou shouldst perish thusand I not know!</p>
<p n="tr">In thy self-slaughter, sister, thou hast slain</p>

<p n="tr">That I may bathe those gashes! If there be</p>
<p n="tr">one hovering breath that stays, let my fond lips</p>
<p n="tr">discover and receive! So saying, she sprang up</p>
<p n="tr">from stair to stair, and, clasping to her breast</p>
<p n="tr">her sister's dying form, moaned grievously,</p>
<p n="tr">and staunched the dark blood with her garment's fold.</p>
<p n="tr">Vainly would Dido lift her sinking eyes,</p>
<p n="tr">but backward fell, while at her heart the wound</p>
<p n="tr">opened afresh; three times with straining arm</p>
<p n="tr">she rose; three times dropped helpless, her dimmed eyes</p>
<p n="tr">turned skyward, seeking the sweet light of day, </p>
<p n="tr">which when she saw, she groaned. <milestone ed="p" n="693" unit="card"/>Great Juno then</p>
<p n="tr">looked down in mercy on that lingering pain</p>

<p n="tr">she sent the goddess of the rainbow wing,</p>
<p n="tr">Iris, to set the struggling spirit free</p>
<p n="tr">and loose its fleshly coil. For since the end</p>
<p n="tr">came not by destiny, nor was the doom</p>
<p n="tr">of guilty deed, but of a hapless wight</p>
<p n="tr">to sudden madness stung, ere ripe to die,</p>
<p n="tr">therefore the Queen of Hades had not shorn</p>
<p n="tr">the fair tress from her forehead, nor assigned</p>
<p n="tr">that soul to Stygian dark. So Iris came</p>
<p n="tr">on dewy, saffron pinions down from heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">a thousand colors on her radiant way,</p>
<p n="tr">from the opposing sun. She stayed her flight</p>
<p n="tr">above that pallid brow: I come with power</p>
<p n="tr">to make this gift to Death. I set thee free</p>
<p n="tr">from thy frail body's bound. With her right hand</p>
<p n="tr">she cut the tress: then through its every limb</p>
<p n="tr">the sinking form grew cold; the vital breath</p>

<p n="tr">Meanwhile Aeneas, now well launched away,</p>
<p n="tr">steered forth with all the fleet to open sea,</p>

<p n="tr">Soon in mid-sea, beyond all chart of shore,</p>

<p n="tr">the annual cycle of revolving time,</p>
<p n="tr">since the dear relics of my god-like sire</p>

<p n="tr">twined round the tomb and trailed innocuous o'er</p>
<p n="tr">the very altars; his smooth back was flecked</p>
<p n="tr">with green and azure, and his changeful scales</p>
<p n="tr">gleamed golden, as the cloud-born rainbow flings</p>

<p n="tr">Aeneas breathless watched the serpent wind</p>

<p n="tr">Here was the goal; and here Aeneas set</p>

<p n="tr">the courses of their ships in sweeping curves</p>

<p n="tr">rang to the rowers, shouting, while their arms</p>
<p n="tr">pulled every inch and flung the waves in foam;</p>
<p n="tr">deep cut the rival strokes; the surface fair</p>

<p n="tr">while all the crowd acclaims, sped Gyas' keel</p>

<p n="tr">pushed hard upon, with stronger stroke of oars</p>
<p n="tr">but heavier ship. At equal pace behind</p>
<p n="tr">the Pristis and the Centaur fiercely strive</p>
<p n="tr">for the third place. Now Pristis seems to lead,</p>
<p n="tr">now mightier Centaur past her flies, then both</p>
<p n="tr">ride on together, prow with prow, and cleave</p>
<p n="tr">long lines of foaming furrow with swift keels.</p>
<p n="tr">Soon near the rock they drew, and either ship</p>

<p n="tr">Hug shore! Let every oar-blade almost graze</p>
<p n="tr">that reef to larboard! Let the others take</p>

<p n="tr">Menoetes, dreading unknown rocks below,</p>
<p n="tr">veered off to open sea. Why steer so wide?</p>
<p n="tr">Round to the rock, Menoetes! Gyas roared, </p>
<p n="tr">again in vain, for looking back he saw</p>
<p n="tr">cloanthus hard astern, and ever nearer,</p>
<p n="tr">who, in a trice, betwixt the booming reef</p>

<p n="tr">the beak of Scylla to the inside course,</p>
<p n="tr">and, quickly taking lead, flew past the goal</p>

<p n="tr">up the rude rock graybeard Menoetes climbed</p>
<p n="tr">with garment dripping wet, and there dropped down</p>
<p n="tr">upon the cliff's dry top. With laughter loud</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan crews had watched him plunging, swimming,</p>

<p n="tr">they enter the home-stretch. Beneath their stroke</p>
<p n="tr">the brass-decked galley throbs, and under her</p>
<p n="tr">the sea-floor drops away. On, on they fly!</p>
<p n="tr">Parched are the panting lips, and sweat in streams</p>
<p n="tr">pours down their giant sides; but lucky chance</p>
<p n="tr">brought the proud heroes what their honor craved.</p>
<p n="tr">For while Sergestus furiously drove</p>
<p n="tr">his ship's beak toward the rock, and kept inside</p>
<p n="tr">the scanty passage, by his evil star</p>
<p n="tr">he grounded on the jutting reef; the cliffs</p>
<p n="tr">rang with the blow, and his entangled oars</p>
<p n="tr">grated along the jagged granite, while</p>
<p n="tr">the prow hung wrecked and helpless. With loud cry</p>
<p n="tr">upsprang the sailors, while the ship stood still,</p>
<p n="tr">and pushed off with long poles and pointed iron,</p>
<p n="tr">or snatched the smashed oars from the whirling tide.</p>
<p n="tr">Mnestheus exults; and, roused to keener strife</p>
<p n="tr">by happy fortune, with a quicker stroke</p>
<p n="tr">of each bright rank of oars, and with the breeze</p>
<p n="tr">his prayer implored, skims o'er the obedient wave</p>
<p n="tr">and sweeps the level main. Not otherwise</p>
<p n="tr">a startled dove, emerging o'er the fields</p>
<p n="tr">from secret cavern in the crannied hill</p>
<p n="tr">where her safe house and pretty nestlings lie,</p>
<p n="tr">soars from her nest, with whirring wingsbut soon</p>
<p n="tr">through the still sky she takes her path of air</p>
<p n="tr">on pinions motionless. So Pristis sped</p>
<p n="tr">with Mnestheus, cleaving her last stretch of sea,</p>
<p n="tr">by her own impulse wafted. She outstripped</p>
<p n="tr">Sergestus first; for he upon the reef</p>
<p n="tr">fought with the breakers, desperately shouting</p>
<p n="tr">for help, for help in vain, with broken oars</p>
<p n="tr">contriving to move on. Then Mnestheus ran</p>
<p n="tr">past Gyas, in Chimaera's ponderous hulk,</p>
<p n="tr">of pilot now bereft; <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="card"/>at last remains</p>
<p n="tr">Cloanthus his sole peer, whom he pursues</p>
<p n="tr">with a supreme endeavor. From the shore</p>
<p n="tr">burst echoing cheers that spur him to the chase,</p>
<p n="tr">and wild applause makes all the welkin ring.</p>
<p n="tr">The leaders now with eager souls would scorn</p>
<p n="tr">to Iose their glory, and faint-hearted fail</p>
<p n="tr">to grasp a prize half-won, but fain would buy</p>
<p n="tr">honor with life itself; the followers too</p>
<p n="tr">are flushed with proud success, and feel them strong</p>
<p n="tr">because their strength is proven. Both ships now</p>
<p n="tr">with indistinguishable prows had sped</p>
<p n="tr">to share one prize,but with uplifted hands</p>
<p n="tr">spread o'er the sea, Cloanthus, suppliant,</p>
<p n="tr">called on the gods to bless his votive prayer:</p>
<p n="tr">Ye gods who rule the waves, whose waters be</p>
<p n="tr">my pathway now; for you on yonder strand</p>
<p n="tr">a white bull at the altar shall be slain</p>
<p n="tr">in grateful tribute for a granted vow;</p>
<p n="tr">and o'er the salt waves I will scatter far</p>
<p n="tr">the entrails, and outpour the flowing wine.</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke; and from the caverns under sea</p>
<p n="tr">Phorcus and virgin Panopea heard,</p>
<p n="tr">and all the sea-nymphs' choir; while with strong hand</p>
<p n="tr">the kindly God of Havens rose and thrust</p>
<p n="tr">the gliding ship along, that swifter flew</p>
<p n="tr">than south wind, or an arrow from the string,</p>
<p n="tr">and soon made land in haven safe and sure.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="244" unit="card"/>Aeneas then, assembling all to hear,</p>
<p n="tr">by a far-sounding herald's voice proclaimed</p>
<p n="tr">Cloanthus victor, and arrayed his brows</p>
<p n="tr">with the green laurel-garland; to the crews</p>
<p n="tr">three bulls, at choice, were given, and plenteous wine</p>
<p n="tr">and talent-weight of silver; to the chiefs</p>
<p n="tr">illustrious gifts beside; the victor had</p>
<p n="tr">a gold-embroidered mantle with wide band</p>
<p n="tr">of undulant Meliboean purple rare,</p>
<p n="tr">where, pictured in the woof, young Ganymede</p>
<p n="tr">through Ida's forest chased the light-foot deer</p>
<p n="tr">with javelin; all flushed and panting he.</p>
<p n="tr">But lo! Jove's thunder-bearing eagle fell,</p>
<p n="tr">and his strong talons snatched from Ida far</p>
<p n="tr">the royal boy, whose aged servitors</p>
<p n="tr">reached helpless hands to heaven; his faithful hound</p>
<p n="tr">bayed fiercely at the air. To him whose worth</p>
<p n="tr">the second place had won, Aeneas gave</p>
<p n="tr">a smooth-linked golden corselet, triple-chained,</p>
<p n="tr">of which his own victorious hand despoiled</p>
<p n="tr">Demoleos, by the swift, embattled stream</p>
<p n="tr">of Simois, under <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,and bade it be</p>
<p n="tr">a glory and defence on valor's field;</p>
<p n="tr">scarce might the straining shoulders of two slaves,</p>
<p n="tr">Phegeus and Sagaris, the load endure,</p>
<p n="tr">yet oft Demoleos in this armor dressed</p>
<p n="tr">charged down full speed on routed hosts of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p>
<p n="tr">The third gift was two cauldrons of wrought brass,</p>
<p n="tr">and bowls of beaten silver, cunningly</p>
<p n="tr">embossed with sculpture fair. Bearing such gifts,</p>
<p n="tr">th' exultant victors onward moved, each brow</p>
<p n="tr">bound with a purple fillet. But behold!</p>
<p n="tr">Sergestus, from the grim rock just dragged off</p>
<p n="tr">by cunning toil, one halting rank of oars</p>
<p n="tr">left of his many lost, comes crawling in</p>
<p n="tr">with vanquished ship, a mockery to all.</p>
<p n="tr">As when a serpent, on the highway caught,</p>
<p n="tr">some brazen wheel has crushed, or traveller</p>
<p n="tr">with heavy-smiting blow left half alive</p>
<p n="tr">and mangled by a stone; in vain he moves</p>
<p n="tr">in writhing flight; a part is lifted high</p>
<p n="tr">with hissing throat and angry, glittering eyes;</p>
<p n="tr">but by the wounded part a captive still</p>
<p n="tr">he knots him fold on fold: with such a track</p>
<p n="tr">the maimed ship labored slow; but by her sails</p>
<p n="tr">she still made way, and with full canvas on</p>
<p n="tr">arrived at land. Aeneas then bestowed</p>
<p n="tr">a boon upon Sergestus, as was meet</p>
<p n="tr">for reward of the ship in safety brought</p>
<p n="tr">with all its men; a fair slave was the prize,</p>
<p n="tr">the Cretan Pholoe, well taught to weave,</p>
<p n="tr">and twin boy-babes upon her breast she bore.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="286" unit="card"/>Then good Aeneas, the ship-contest o'er,</p>
<p n="tr">turned to a wide green valley, circled round</p>
<p n="tr">with clasp of wood-clad hills, wherein was made</p>
<p n="tr">an amphitheatre; entering with a throng</p>
<p n="tr">of followers, the hero took his seat</p>
<p n="tr">in mid-arena on a lofty mound.</p>
<p n="tr">For the fleet foot-race, now, his summons flies, </p>
<p n="tr">he offers gifts, and shows the rewards due.</p>
<p n="tr">The mingling youth of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName></p>
<p n="tr">hastened from far. Among the foremost came</p>
<p n="tr">the comrades Nisus and Euryalus,</p>
<p n="tr">Euryalus for beauty's bloom renowned,</p>
<p n="tr">Nisus for loyal love; close-following these</p>
<p n="tr">Diores strode, a prince of Priam's line;</p>
<p n="tr">then Salius and Patron, who were bred</p>
<p n="tr">in <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName> and Arcady;</p>
<p n="tr">then two Sicilian warriors, Helymus</p>
<p n="tr">and Panopes, both sylvan bred and born,</p>
<p n="tr">comrades of King Acestes; after these</p>
<p n="tr">the multitude whom Fame forgets to tell.</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas, so surrounded, thus spake forth:</p>
<p n="tr">Hear what I purpose, and with joy receive!</p>
<p n="tr">of all your company, not one departs</p>
<p n="tr">with empty hand. The Cretan javelins</p>
<p n="tr">bright-tipped with burnished steel, and battle-axe</p>
<p n="tr">adorned with graven silver, these shall be</p>
<p n="tr">the meed of all. The three first at the goal</p>
<p n="tr">shall bind their foreheads with fair olive green,</p>
<p n="tr">and win the rewards due. The first shall lead,</p>
<p n="tr">victorious, yon rich-bridled steed away;</p>
<p n="tr">this Amazonian quiver, the next prize,</p>
<p n="tr">well-stocked with Thracian arrows; round it goes</p>
<p n="tr">a baldrick broad and golden,in its clasp</p>
<p n="tr">a lustrous gem. The third man goes away</p>
<p n="tr">taking this helmet from the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> spoil.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="card"/>They heard, and took their places. The loud horn</p>
<p n="tr">gave signal, and impetuous from the line,</p>
<p n="tr">swift as a bursting storm they sped away,</p>
<p n="tr">eyes fixed upon the goal. Far in advance</p>
<p n="tr">Nisus shot forward, swifter than the winds</p>
<p n="tr">or winged thunderbolt; the next in course,</p>
<p n="tr">next, but out-rivalled far, was Salius,</p>
<p n="tr">and after him a space, Euryalus</p>
<p n="tr">came third; him Helymus was hard upon;</p>
<p n="tr">and, look! Diores follows, heel on heel,</p>
<p n="tr">close at his shoulderif the race be long</p>
<p n="tr">he sure must win, or claim a doubtful prize.</p>
<p n="tr">Now at the last stretch, spent and panting, all</p>
<p n="tr">pressed to the goal, when in a slime of blood</p>
<p n="tr">Nisus, hard fate! slipped down, where late the death</p>
<p n="tr">of victims slain had drenched the turf below.</p>
<p n="tr">Here the young victor, with his triumph flushed,</p>
<p n="tr">lost foothold on the yielding ground, and plunged</p>
<p n="tr">face forward in the pool of filth and gore;</p>
<p n="tr">but not of dear Euryalus was he</p>
<p n="tr">forgetful then, nor heedless of his friend;</p>
<p n="tr">but rising from the mire he hurled himself</p>
<p n="tr">in Salius' way; so he in equal plight</p>
<p n="tr">rolled in the filthy slough. Euryalus</p>
<p n="tr">leaped forth, the winner of the race by gift</p>
<p n="tr">of his true friend, and flying to the goal</p>
<p n="tr">stood first, by many a favoring shout acclaimed.</p>
<p n="tr">Next Helymus ran in; and, for the third, last prize,</p>
<p n="tr">Diores. But the multitude now heard</p>
<p n="tr">the hollowed hill-side ringing with wild wrath</p>
<p n="tr">from Salius, clamoring where the chieftains sate</p>
<p n="tr">for restitution of his stolen prize,</p>
<p n="tr">lost by a cheat. But general favor smiles</p>
<p n="tr">upon Euryalus, whose beauteous tears</p>
<p n="tr">commend him much, and nobler seems the worth</p>
<p n="tr">of valor clothed in youthful shape so fair.</p>
<p n="tr">Diores, too, assists the victor's claim,</p>
<p n="tr">with loud appealhe too has won a prize,</p>
<p n="tr">and vainly holds his last place, if the first</p>
<p n="tr">to Salius fall. <milestone ed="p" n="348" unit="card"/>Aeneas then replied:</p>
<p n="tr">Your gifts, my gallant youths, remain secure.</p>
<p n="tr">None can re-judge the prize. But to console</p>
<p n="tr">the misadventure of a blameless friend,</p>
<p n="tr">is in my power. Therewith to Salius</p>
<p n="tr">an Afric lion's monstrous pelt he gave,</p>
<p n="tr">with ponderous mane, the claws o'erlaid with gold.</p>
<p n="tr">But Nisus cried: If such a gift be found</p>
<p n="tr">for less than victory, and men who fall</p>
<p n="tr">are worthy so much sorrow, pray, what prize</p>
<p n="tr">shall Nisus have? For surely I had won</p>
<p n="tr">the proudest of the garlands, if one stroke</p>
<p n="tr">of inauspicious fortune had not fallen</p>
<p n="tr">on Salius and me. So saying, he showed</p>
<p n="tr">his smeared face and his sorry limbs befouled</p>
<p n="tr">with mire and slime. Then laughed the gracious sire,</p>
<p n="tr">and bade a shield be brought, the cunning work</p>
<p n="tr">of Didymaon, which the Greeks tore down</p>
<p n="tr">from Neptune's temple; with this noble gift</p>
<p n="tr">he sent the high-born youth upon his way.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="362" unit="card"/>The foot-race over and the gifts disbursed,</p>
<p n="tr">Come forth! he cries, if any in his heart</p>
<p n="tr">have strength and valor, let him now pull on</p>
<p n="tr">the gauntlets and uplift his thong-bound arms</p>
<p n="tr">in challenge. For the reward of this fight</p>
<p n="tr">a two-fold gift he showed: the victor's meed,</p>
<p n="tr">a bullock decked and gilded; but a sword</p>
<p n="tr">and glittering helmet to console the fallen.</p>
<p n="tr">Straightway, in all his pride of giant strength,</p>
<p n="tr">Dares Ioomed up, and wondering murmurs ran</p>
<p n="tr">along the gazing crowd; for he alone</p>
<p n="tr">was wont to match with Paris, he it was</p>
<p n="tr">met Butes, the huge-bodied champion</p>
<p n="tr">boasting the name and race of Amycus,</p>
<p n="tr">Bythinian-born; him felled he at a blow,</p>
<p n="tr">and stretched him dying on the tawny sand.</p>
<p n="tr">Such Dares was, who now held high his head,</p>
<p n="tr">fierce for the fray, bared both his shoulders broad,</p>
<p n="tr">lunged out with left and right, and beat the air.</p>
<p n="tr">Who shall his rival be? Of all the throng</p>
<p n="tr">not one puts on the gauntlets, or would face</p>
<p n="tr">the hero's challenge. Therefore, striding forth,</p>
<p n="tr">believing none now dare but yield the palm,</p>
<p n="tr">he stood before Aeneas, and straightway</p>
<p n="tr">seized with his left hand the bull's golden horn,</p>
<p n="tr">and cried, O goddess-born, if no man dares</p>
<p n="tr">to risk him in this fight, how Iong delay?</p>
<p n="tr">how Iong beseems it I should stand and wait?</p>
<p n="tr">Bid me bear off my prize. The Trojans all</p>
<p n="tr">murmured assent, and bade the due award</p>
<p n="tr">of promised gift. <milestone ed="p" n="387" unit="card"/>But with a brow severe</p>
<p n="tr">Acestes to Entellus at his side</p>
<p n="tr">addressed upbraiding words, where they reclined</p>
<p n="tr">on grassy bank and couch of pleasant green:</p>
<p n="tr">O my Entellus, in the olden days</p>
<p n="tr">bravest among the mighty, but in vain!</p>
<p n="tr">Endurest thou to see yon reward won</p>
<p n="tr">without a blow? Where, prithee, is that god</p>
<p n="tr">who taught thee? Are thy tales of <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> vain?</p>
<p n="tr">Does all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicilia</placeName> praise thee? Is thy roof</p>
<p n="tr">with trophies hung? The other in reply:</p>
<p n="tr">My jealous honor and good name yield not</p>
<p n="tr">to fear. But age, so cold and slow to move,</p>
<p n="tr">makes my blood laggard, and my ebbing powers</p>
<p n="tr">in all my body are but slack and chill.</p>
<p n="tr">O, if I had what yonder ruffian boasts</p>
<p n="tr">my own proud youth once more! I would not ask</p>
<p n="tr">the fair bull for a prize, nor to the lists</p>
<p n="tr">in search of gifts come forth. So saying, he threw</p>
<p n="tr">into the mid-arena a vast pair</p>
<p n="tr">of ponderous gauntlets, which in former days</p>
<p n="tr">fierce <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> for his fights was wont to bind</p>
<p n="tr">on hand and arm, with the stiff raw-hide thong.</p>
<p n="tr">All marvelled; for a weight of seven bulls' hides</p>
<p n="tr">was pieced with lead and iron. Dares stared</p>
<p n="tr">astonished, and step after step recoiled;</p>
<p n="tr">high-souled Anchises' son, this way and that,</p>
<p n="tr">turned o'er the enormous coil of knots and thongs;</p>
<p n="tr">then with a deep-drawn breath the veteran spoke:</p>
<p n="tr">O, that thy wondering eyes had seen the arms</p>
<p n="tr">of Hercules, and what his gauntlets were!</p>
<p n="tr">Would thou hadst seen the conflict terrible</p>
<p n="tr">upon this self-same shore! These arms were borne</p>
<p n="tr">by <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>. Look; thy brother's!spattered yet</p>
<p n="tr">with blood, with dashed-out brains! In these he stood</p>
<p n="tr">when he matched Hercules. I wore them oft</p>
<p n="tr">when in my pride and prime, ere envious age</p>
<p n="tr">shed frost upon my brows. But if these arms</p>
<p n="tr">be of our Trojan Dares disapproved,</p>
<p n="tr">if good Aeneas rules it so, and King</p>
<p n="tr">Acestes wills it, let us offer fight</p>
<p n="tr">on even terms. Let <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>' bull's-hide go.</p>
<p n="tr">Tremble no more! But strip those gauntlets off </p>
<p n="tr">fetched here from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. <milestone ed="p" n="421" unit="card"/>So saying, he dropped down</p>
<p n="tr">the double-folded mantle from his shoulders,</p>
<p n="tr">stripped bare the huge joints, the huge arms and thews,</p>
<p n="tr">and towered gigantic in the midmost ring.</p>
<p n="tr">Anchises' son then gave two equal pairs</p>
<p n="tr">of gauntlets, and accoutred with like arms</p>
<p n="tr">both champions. Each lifted him full height</p>
<p n="tr">on tiptoe; each with mien unterrified</p>
<p n="tr">held both fists high in air, and drew his head</p>
<p n="tr">far back from blows assailing. Then they joined</p>
<p n="tr">in struggle hand to hand, and made the fray</p>
<p n="tr">each moment fiercer. One was light of foot</p>
<p n="tr">and on his youth relied; the other strong</p>
<p n="tr">in bulk of every limb, but tottering</p>
<p n="tr">on sluggish knees, while all his body shook</p>
<p n="tr">with labor of his breath. Without avail</p>
<p n="tr">they rained their blows, and on each hollow side,</p>
<p n="tr">each sounding chest, the swift, reverberate strokes</p>
<p n="tr">fell without pause; around their ears and brows</p>
<p n="tr">came blow on blow, and with relentless shocks</p>
<p n="tr">the smitten jaws cracked loud. Entellus stands</p>
<p n="tr">unshaken, and, the self-same posture keeping,</p>
<p n="tr">only by body-movement or quick eye</p>
<p n="tr">parries attack. Dares (like one in siege</p>
<p n="tr">against a mountain-citadel, who now will drive</p>
<p n="tr">with ram and engine at the craggy wall,</p>
<p n="tr">now wait in full-armed watch beneath its towers)</p>
<p n="tr">tries manifold approach, most craftily</p>
<p n="tr">invests each point of vantage, and renews</p>
<p n="tr">his unsuccessful, ever various war.</p>
<p n="tr">Then, rising to the stroke, Entellus poised</p>
<p n="tr">aloft his ponderous right; but, quick of eye,</p>
<p n="tr">the other the descending wrath foresaw</p>
<p n="tr">and nimbly slipped away; Entellus so</p>
<p n="tr">wasted his stroke on air, and, self-o'erthrown,</p>
<p n="tr">dropped prone to earth his monstrous length along,</p>
<p n="tr">as when on Erymanth or Ida falls</p>
<p n="tr">a hollowed pine from giant roots uptorn.</p>
<p n="tr">Alike the Teucrian and Trinacrian throng</p>
<p n="tr">shout wildly; while Acestes, pitying, hastes</p>
<p n="tr">to lift his gray companion. But, unchecked,</p>
<p n="tr">undaunted by his fall, the champion brave</p>
<p n="tr">rushed fiercer to the fight, his strength now roused</p>
<p n="tr">by rage, while shame and courage confident</p>
<p n="tr">kindle his soul; impetuous he drives</p>
<p n="tr">Dares full speed all round the ring, with blows</p>
<p n="tr">redoubled right and left. No stop or stay</p>
<p n="tr">gives he, but like a storm of rattling hail</p>
<p n="tr">upon a house-top, so from each huge hand</p>
<p n="tr">the champion's strokes on dizzy Dares fall.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="461" unit="card"/>Then Sire Aeneas willed to make a stay</p>
<p n="tr">to so much rage, nor let Entellus' soul</p>
<p n="tr">flame beyond bound, but bade the battle pause,</p>
<p n="tr">and, rescuing weary Dares, thus he spoke</p>
<p n="tr">in soothing words: Ill-starred! What mad attempt</p>
<p n="tr">is in thy mind? Will not thy heart confess</p>
<p n="tr">thy strength surpassed, and auspices averse?</p>
<p n="tr">Submit, for Heaven decrees! With such wise words</p>
<p n="tr">he sundered the fell strife. But trusty friends</p>
<p n="tr">bore Dares off: his spent limbs helpless trailed,</p>
<p n="tr">his head he could not lift, and from his lips</p>
<p n="tr">came blood and broken teeth. So to the ship</p>
<p n="tr">they bore him, taking, at Aeneas' word,</p>
<p n="tr">the helmet and the swordbut left behind</p>
<p n="tr">Entellus' prize of victory, the bull.</p>
<p n="tr">He, then, elate and glorying, spoke forth:</p>
<p n="tr">See, goddess-born, and all ye Teucrians, see,</p>
<p n="tr">what strength was mine in youth, and from what death</p>
<p n="tr">ye have clelivered Dares. Saying so,</p>
<p n="tr">he turned him full front to the bull, who stood</p>
<p n="tr">for reward of the fight, and, drawing back</p>
<p n="tr">his right hand, poising the dread gauntlet high,</p>
<p n="tr">swung sheer between the horns and crushed the skull;</p>
<p n="tr">a trembling, lifeless creature, to the ground</p>
<p n="tr">the bull dropped forward dead. Above the fallen</p>
<p n="tr">Entellus cried aloud, This victim due</p>
<p n="tr">I give thee, <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>, more acceptable</p>
<p n="tr">than Dares' death to thy benignant shade.</p>
<p n="tr">For this last victory and joyful day,</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="card"/>Forthwith Aeneas summons all who will</p>

<p n="tr">of good Sergestus taken; and thereto</p>
<p n="tr">a fluttering dove by winding cord is bound</p>

<p n="tr">came from the helmet last, whose royal hand</p>
<p n="tr">the deeds of youth dared even yet to try.</p>
<p n="tr">Each then with strong arm bends his pliant bow,</p>
<p n="tr">each from the quiver plucks a chosen shaft.</p>
<p n="tr">First, with loud arrow whizzing from the string,</p>
<p n="tr">the young Hippocoon with skyward aim</p>
<p n="tr">cuts through the yielding air; and lo! his barb</p>
<p n="tr">pierces the very wood, and makes the mast</p>
<p n="tr">tremble; while with a fluttering, frighted wing</p>
<p n="tr">the bird tugs hard,and plaudits fill the sky.</p>
<p n="tr">Boldly rose Mnestheus, and with bow full-drawn</p>
<p n="tr">aimed both his eye and shaft aloft; but he</p>

<p n="tr">up to the dove herself, just cut the cord</p>
<p n="tr">and broke the hempen bond, whereby her feet</p>

<p n="tr">But swiftlyfor upon his waiting bow</p>
<p n="tr">he held a shaft in restEurytion</p>
<p n="tr">invoked his brother's shade, and, marking well</p>
<p n="tr">the dove, whose happy pinions fluttered free</p>
<p n="tr">in vacant sky, pierced her, hard by a cloud;</p>
<p n="tr">lifeless she fell, and left in light of heaven</p>

<p n="tr">to show his prowess and resounding bow,</p>
<p n="tr">hurl forth one shaft in air; then suddenly</p>
<p n="tr">all eyes beheld such wonder as portends</p>
<p n="tr">events to be (but when fulfilment came,</p>
<p n="tr">too late the fearful seers its warning sung):</p>
<p n="tr">for, soaring through the stream of cloud, his shaft</p>
<p n="tr">took fire, tracing its bright path in flame,</p>

<p n="tr">his brows with garland of the laurel green,</p>

<p n="tr">Nor could Eurytion, noble youth, think ill</p>
<p n="tr">of honor which his own surpassed, though he,</p>
<p n="tr">he only, pierced the bird in upper air.</p>

<p n="tr">She scanned the vast assemblage; then her gaze</p>
<p n="tr">turned shoreward, where along the idle bay</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan galleys quite unpeopled rode.</p>
<p n="tr">But far removed, upon a lonely shore,</p>
<p n="tr">a throng of Trojan dames bewailed aloud</p>

<p n="tr">the mighty deep. O weary waste of seas!</p>
<p n="tr">What vast, untravelled floods beyond us roll!</p>
<p n="tr">So cried they with one voice, and prayed the gods</p>

<p n="tr">Then in their midst alighted, not unskilled</p>

<p n="tr">waved it all flaming, and with furious arm</p>
<p n="tr">hurled it from far. The Ilian matrons gazed,</p>
<p n="tr">bewildered and appalled. But one, of all</p>
<p n="tr">the eldest, Pyrgo, venerated nurse</p>

<p n="tr">This is no <placeName key="tgn,1026962">Beroe</placeName>, my noble dames.</p>

<p n="tr">that she, she only, had no gift to bring</p>
<p n="tr">of mournful honor to Anchises' shade.</p>
<p n="tr">She spoke. The women with ill-boding eyes</p>
<p n="tr">looked on the ships. Their doubting hearts were torn</p>
<p n="tr">'twixt tearful passion for the beauteous isle</p>
<p n="tr">their feet then trod, and that prophetic call</p>
<p n="tr">of Fate to lands unknown. Then on wide wings</p>
<p n="tr">soared Iris into heaven, and through the clouds</p>
<p n="tr">clove a vast arch of light. With wonder dazed,</p>
<p n="tr">the women in a shrieking frenzy rose,</p>
<p n="tr">took embers from the hearth-stones, stole the fires</p>
<p n="tr">upon the altarsfaggots, branches, brands </p>
<p n="tr">and rained them on the ships. The god of fire,</p>

<p n="tr">the clouds of smoke and hovering flame could see.</p>
<p n="tr">Ascanius, who had led with smiling brow</p>

<p n="tr">What is it ye would do? he cried. Alas!</p>
<p n="tr">Ill-fated women! Not our enemies,</p>
<p n="tr">nor the dread bulwarks of the Greek ye burn,</p>
<p n="tr">but all ye have to hope for. Look at me,</p>
<p n="tr">your own Ascanius! His helmet then</p>
<p n="tr">into their midst he flung, which he had worn</p>
<p n="tr">for pageantry of war. Aeneas, too,</p>
<p n="tr">with Trojan bands sped thither. But far off,</p>
<p n="tr">the women, panic-scattered on the shore,</p>
<p n="tr">fled many ways, and deep in caverned crags</p>
<p n="tr">or shadowed forests hid them, for they Ioathed</p>
<p n="tr">their deed and life itself; their thoughts were changed;</p>
<p n="tr">they knew their kin and husbands, and their hearts</p>

<p n="tr">the burning and indomitable flames</p>
<p n="tr">raged without stay; beneath the ships' smeared sides</p>
<p n="tr">the hempen fuel puffed a lingering smoke,</p>
<p n="tr">as, through the whole bulk creeping, the slow fire</p>
<p n="tr">devoured its way; and little it availed</p>
<p n="tr">that strong men fought the fire with stream on stream.</p>
<p n="tr">Then good Aeneas from his shoulder rent</p>
<p n="tr">his garment, and with lifted hands implored</p>
<p n="tr">the help of Heaven. O Jove omnipotent!</p>
<p n="tr">If thou not yet thy wrath implacable</p>
<p n="tr">on every Trojan pourest, if thou still</p>
<p n="tr">hast pity, as of old, for what men bear,</p>
<p n="tr">O, grant my fleet deliverance from this flame!</p>
<p n="tr">From uttermost destruction, Father, save</p>
<p n="tr">our desperate Trojan cause! Or even now </p>
<p n="tr">last cruelty! thy fatal thunders throw.</p>
<p n="tr">If this be my just meed, let thy dread arm</p>
<p n="tr">confound us all. But scarce the prayer is said,</p>
<p n="tr">when with a bursting deluge a dark storm</p>
<p n="tr">falls, marvellous to see; while hills and plains</p>
<p n="tr">with thunder shake, and to each rim of heaven</p>
<p n="tr">spreads swollen cloud-rack, black with copious rain</p>
<p n="tr">and multitudinous gales. The full flood pours</p>
<p n="tr">on every ship, and all the smouldering beams</p>
<p n="tr">are drenched, until the smoke and flames expire</p>
<p n="tr">and (though four ships be lost) the burning fleet</p>
<p n="tr">rides rescued from its doom. <milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="card"/>But smitten sore</p>
<p n="tr">by this mischance, Aeneas doubtfully</p>
<p n="tr">weighs in his heart its mighty load of cares,</p>

<p n="tr">in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, not heeding prophet-songs,</p>

<p n="tr">to show celestial anger's warning signs,</p>
<p n="tr">or tell Fate's fixed decree. The gifted man</p>
<p n="tr">thus to Aeneas comfortably spoke:</p>
<p n="tr">O goddess-born, we follow here or there,</p>
<p n="tr">as Fate compels or stays. But come what may,</p>

<p n="tr">the noble counsels aged Nautes gave.</p>
<p n="tr">Only with warriors of dauntless breast</p>
<p n="tr">to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> repair; of hardy breed,</p>

<p n="tr">with tidings of a stranger company</p>
<p n="tr">in foreign garb approaching. The good King</p>

<p n="tr">Here kings took sceptre and the fasces proud</p>

<p n="tr">O sons of Dardanus, think not unknown</p>
<p n="tr">your lineage and city! Rumored far</p>
<p n="tr">your venturous voyage has been. What seek ye here?</p>
<p n="tr">What cause, what quest, has brought your barks and you</p>
<p n="tr">o'er the blue waters to Ausonia's hills?</p>
<p n="tr">What way uncharted, or wild stress of storm,</p>
<p n="tr">or what that sailors suffer in mid-sea,</p>

<p n="tr">Doubt not our welcome! We of Latin land</p>

<p n="tr">Now I bethink me our Ausonian seers</p>

<p n="tr">Nor star deceived, nor strange, bewildering shore</p>

<p n="tr">by our free choice and with deliberate aim</p>
<p n="tr">to this thy town, though exiled forth of realms</p>
<p n="tr">once mightiest of all the sun-god sees</p>

<p n="tr">a tempest vast, and by what stroke of doom </p>
<p n="tr">all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>'s world with <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> clashed in war,</p>

<p n="tr">whose dwelling is the ample zone that burns</p>

<p n="tr">far severed from the world. We are the men</p>
<p n="tr">from war's destroying deluge safely borne</p>
<p n="tr">over the waters wide. We only ask</p>
<p n="tr">some low-roofed dwelling for our fathers' gods,</p>

<p n="tr">water and air. We bring no evil name</p>
<p n="tr">upon thy people; thy renown will be</p>

<p n="tr">can grateful memory die. Ye ne'er will rue</p>
<p n="tr">that to Ausonia's breast ye gathered <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p>
<p n="tr">I swear thee by the favored destinies</p>

<p n="tr">in friendship or in war, that many a tribe</p>
<p n="tr">(O, scorn us not, that, bearing olive green,</p>

<p n="tr">has sued us to be friends. But Fate's decree</p>

<p n="tr">Anchises poured libation when he prayed;</p>

<p n="tr">Ilioneus. But King Latinus gazed</p>

<p n="tr">save for his musing eyes. The broidered pall</p>
<p n="tr">of purple, and the sceptre Priam bore,</p>
<p n="tr">moved little on his kingly heart, which now</p>
<p n="tr">pondered of giving to the bridal bed</p>
<p n="tr">his daughter dear. He argues in his mind</p>
<p n="tr">the oracle of Faunus:might this be</p>
<p n="tr">that destined bridegroom from an alien land,</p>
<p n="tr">to share his throne, to get a progeny</p>
<p n="tr">of glorious valor, which by mighty deeds</p>
<p n="tr">should win the world for kingdom? So at last</p>
<p n="tr">with joyful brow he spoke: Now let the gods</p>
<p n="tr">our purpose and their own fair promise bless!</p>
<p n="tr">Thou hast, O Trojan, thy desire. Thy gifts</p>
<p n="tr">I have not scorned; nor while Latinus reigns</p>
<p n="tr">shall ye lack riches in my plenteous land,</p>
<p n="tr">not less than Trojan store. But where is he,</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas' self? If he our royal love</p>
<p n="tr">so much desire, and have such urgent mind</p>
<p n="tr">to be our guest and friend, let him draw near,</p>
<p n="tr">nor turn him from well-wishing looks away!</p>
<p n="tr">My offering and pledge of peace shall be</p>
<p n="tr">to clasp your monarch's hand. Bear back, I pray,</p>
<p n="tr">this answer to your King: my dwelling holds</p>
<p n="tr">a daughter, whom with husband of her blood</p>
<p n="tr">great signs in heaven and from my father's tomb</p>
<p n="tr">forbid to wed. A son from alien shores</p>
<p n="tr">they prophesy for <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>'s heir, whose seed</p>
<p n="tr">shall lift our glory to the stars divine.</p>
<p n="tr">I am persuaded this is none but he,</p>
<p n="tr">that man of destiny; and if my heart</p>
<p n="tr">be no false prophet, I desire it so.</p>
<p n="tr">Thus having said, the sire took chosen steeds</p>
<p n="tr">from his full herd, whereof, well-groomed and fair,</p>
<p n="tr">three hundred stood within his ample pale.</p>
<p n="tr">Of these to every Teucrian guest he gave</p>
<p n="tr">a courser swift and strong, in purple clad</p>
<p n="tr">and broidered housings gay; on every breast</p>
<p n="tr">hung chains of gold; in golden robes arrayed,</p>
<p n="tr">they champed the red gold curb their teeth between.</p>
<p n="tr">For offering to Aeneas, he bade send</p>
<p n="tr">a chariot, with chargers twain of seed</p>
<p n="tr">ethereal, their nostrils breathing fire:</p>
<p n="tr">the famous kind which guileful Circe bred,</p>
<p n="tr">cheating her sire, and mixed the sun-god's team</p>
<p n="tr">with brood-mares earthly born. The sons of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,</p>

<p n="tr">pachynus, sees Dardania's rescued fleet,</p>
<p n="tr">and all Aeneas' joy. The prospect shows</p>
<p n="tr">houses a-building, lands of safe abode,</p>
<p n="tr">and the abandoned ships. With bitter grief</p>
<p n="tr">she stands at gaze: then with storm-shaken brows,</p>
<p n="tr">thus from her heart lets loose the wrathful word:</p>
<p n="tr">O hated race! O Phrygian destinies </p>
<p n="tr">to mine forevermore (unhappy me!)</p>
<p n="tr">a scandal and offense! Did no one die</p>
<p n="tr">on <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s embattled plain? Could captured slaves</p>
<p n="tr">not be enslaved again? Was Ilium's flame</p>
<p n="tr">no warrior's funeral pyre? Did they walk safe</p>
<p n="tr">through serried swords and congregated fires?</p>
<p n="tr">At last, methought, my godhead might repose,</p>
<p n="tr">and my full-fed revenge in slumber lie.</p>
<p n="tr">But nay! Though flung forth from their native land,</p>
<p n="tr">I o'er the waves, with enmity unstayed,</p>
<p n="tr">dared give them chase, and on that exiled few</p>
<p n="tr">hurled the whole sea. I smote the sons of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></p>
<p n="tr">with ocean's power and heaven's. But what availed</p>
<p n="tr">Syrtes, or Scylla, or Charybdis' waves?</p>
<p n="tr">The Trojans are in <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; and abide</p>
<p n="tr">within their prayed-for land delectable,</p>
<p n="tr">safe from the seas and me! Mars once had power</p>
<p n="tr">the monstrous Lapithae to slay; and Jove</p>
<p n="tr">to Dian's honor and revenge gave o'er</p>
<p n="tr">the land of Calydon. What crime so foul</p>
<p n="tr">was wrought by Lapithae or Calydon?</p>
<p n="tr">But I, Jove's wife and Queen, who in my woes</p>

<p n="tr">If Heaven I may not move, on Hell I call.</p>
<p n="tr">To bar him from his Latin throne exceeds</p>

<p n="tr">Let Teucrian and Rutulian slaughter be</p>

<p n="tr">Betwixt her smooth breast and her robe it wound</p>

<p n="tr">the fillets on her brow, or with her hair</p>

<p n="tr">in gentle accents such as mothers use;</p>

<p n="tr">Then horror broke his sleep, and fearful sweat</p>

<p n="tr">Rutulia's warriors rushed into array;</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="card"/>While Turnus stirred Rutulia's valiant souls,</p>
<p n="tr">Alecto on her Stygian pinions sped</p>
<p n="tr">to where the Teucrians lay. She scanned the ground</p>
<p n="tr">with eager guile, where by the river's marge</p>
<p n="tr">fair-browed Iulus with his nets and snares</p>
<p n="tr">rode fiercely to the chase. Then o'er his hounds</p>
<p n="tr">that hell-born virgin breathed a sudden rage,</p>
<p n="tr">and filled each cunning nostril with the scent</p>
<p n="tr">of stags, till forth in wild pursuit they flew.</p>
<p n="tr">Here all the woe began, and here awoke</p>
<p n="tr">in rustic souls the swift-enkindling war.</p>
<p n="tr">For a fair stag, tall-antlered, stolen away</p>
<p n="tr">even from its mother's milk, had long been kept</p>
<p n="tr">by Tyrrhus and his sonsthe shepherd he</p>
<p n="tr">of all the royal flocks, and forester</p>
<p n="tr">of a wide region round. With fondest care</p>
<p n="tr">their sister Silvia entwined its horns</p>
<p n="tr">with soft, fresh garlands, tamed it to run close,</p>
<p n="tr">and combed the creature, or would bring to bathe</p>
<p n="tr">at a clear, crystal spring. It knew the hands</p>
<p n="tr">of all its gentle masters, and would feed</p>
<p n="tr">from their own dish; or wandering through the wood,</p>
<p n="tr">come back unguided to their friendly door,</p>
<p n="tr">though deep the evening shade. Iulus' dogs</p>
<p n="tr">now roused this wanderer in their ravening chase,</p>
<p n="tr">as, drifted down-stream far from home it lay,</p>
<p n="tr">on a green bank a-cooling. From bent bow</p>
<p n="tr">Ascanius, eager for a hunter's praise,</p>
<p n="tr">let go his shaft; nor did Alecto fail</p>
<p n="tr">his aim to guide: but, whistling through the air,</p>
<p n="tr">the light-winged reed pierced deep in flank and side.</p>
<p n="tr">Swift to its cover fled the wounded thing,</p>
<p n="tr">and crept loud-moaning to its wonted stall,</p>
<p n="tr">where, like a blood-stained suppliant, it seemed</p>
<p n="tr">to fill that shepherd's house with plaintive prayer.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Silvia the sister, smiting oft</p>
<p n="tr">on breast and arm, made cry for help, and called</p>
<p n="tr">the sturdy rustics forth in gathering throng.</p>
<p n="tr">These now (for in the silent forest couched</p>
<p n="tr">the cruel Fury) swift to battle flew.</p>
<p n="tr">One brandished a charred stake, another swung</p>
<p n="tr">a knotted cudgel, as rude anger shapes</p>
<p n="tr">its weapon of whate'er the searching eye</p>
<p n="tr">first haps to fall on. Tyrrhus roused his clans,</p>
<p n="tr">just when by chance he split with blows of wedge</p>
<p n="tr">an oak in four; and, panting giant breath,</p>
<p n="tr">shouldered his woodman's axe. <milestone ed="p" n="511" unit="card"/>Alecto then,</p>
<p n="tr">prompt to the stroke of mischief, soared aloft</p>
<p n="tr">from where she spying sate, to the steep roof</p>
<p n="tr">of a tall byre, and from its peak of straw</p>
<p n="tr">blew a wild signal on a shepherd's horn,</p>
<p n="tr">outflinging her infernal note so far</p>
<p n="tr">that all the forest shuddered, and the grove</p>
<p n="tr">throbbed to its deepest glen. Cold Trivia's lake</p>
<p n="tr">from end to end gave ear, and every wave</p>
<p n="tr">of the white stream of Nar, the lonely pools</p>
<p n="tr">of still Velinus heard: while at the sound</p>
<p n="tr">pale mothers to their breasts their children drew.</p>
<p n="tr">Swift to the signal of the dreadful horn, </p>
<p n="tr">snatching their weapons rude, the freeborn swains</p>
<p n="tr">assembled for the fray; the Trojan bands</p>
<p n="tr">poured from their bivouac with instant aid </p>
<p n="tr">for young Ascanius. In array of war</p>
<p n="tr">both stand confronting. Not mere rustic brawl</p>
<p n="tr">with charred oak-staff and cudgel is the fight,</p>
<p n="tr">but with the two-edged steel; the naked swords</p>
<p n="tr">wave like dark-bladed harvest-field, while far</p>
<p n="tr">the brazen arms flash in the smiting sun,</p>
<p n="tr">and skyward fling their beam: so some wide sea,</p>
<p n="tr">at first but whitened in the rising wind,</p>
<p n="tr">swells its slow-rolling mass and ever higher</p>
<p n="tr">its billows rears, until the utmost deep</p>
<p n="tr">lifts in one surge to heaven. The first to fall</p>
<p n="tr">was Almo, eldest-born of Tyrrhus' sons,</p>
<p n="tr">whom, striding in the van, a loud-winged shaft</p>
<p n="tr">laid low in death; deep in his throat it clung,</p>
<p n="tr">and silenced with his blood the dying cry</p>
<p n="tr">of his frail life. Around him fell the forms</p>
<p n="tr">of many a brave and strong; among them died</p>
<p n="tr">gray-haired Galaesus pleading for a truce:</p>
<p n="tr">righteous he was, and of Ausonian fields</p>
<p n="tr">a prosperous master; five full flocks had he</p>
<p n="tr">of bleating sheep, and from his pastures came</p>
<p n="tr">five herds of cattle home; his busy churls</p>
<p n="tr">turned with a hundred ploughs his fruitful glebe.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="card"/>While o'er the battle-field thus doubtful swung</p>
<p n="tr">the scales of war, the Fury (to her task</p>
<p n="tr">now equal proven) having dyed the day</p>
<p n="tr">a deep-ensanguined hue, and opened fight</p>
<p n="tr">with death and slaughter, made no tarrying</p>
<p n="tr">within Hesperia, but skyward soared,</p>
<p n="tr">and, Ioud in triumph, insolently thus</p>
<p n="tr">to Juno called: See, at thy will, their strife</p>
<p n="tr">full-blown to war and woe! Could even thyself</p>
<p n="tr">command them now to truce and amity?</p>
<p n="tr">But I, that with Ausonia's blood befoul</p>
<p n="tr">their Trojan hands, yet more can do, if thou</p>
<p n="tr">shift not thy purpose. For with dire alarms</p>
<p n="tr">I will awake the bordering states to war</p>
<p n="tr">enkindling in their souls the frenzied lust</p>
<p n="tr">the war-god breathes; till from th' horizon round</p>
<p n="tr">the reinforcement poursI scattering seeds</p>
<p n="tr">of carnage through the land. In answer spoke</p>
<p n="tr">juno: Enough of artifice and fear!</p>
<p n="tr">Thy provocation works. Now have they joined</p>
<p n="tr">in close and deadly combat, and warm blood</p>
<p n="tr">those sudden-leaping swords incarnadines,</p>
<p n="tr">which chance put in their hands. Such nuptial joys,</p>
<p n="tr">such feast of wedlock, let the famous son</p>

<p n="tr">But yon Olympian Sire and King no more</p>
<p n="tr">permits thee freely in our skies to roam.</p>
<p n="tr">Go, quit the field! Myself will take control</p>
<p n="tr">of hazards and of labors yet to be.</p>
<p n="tr">Thus Saturn's daughter spoke. Alecto then,</p>
<p n="tr">unfolding far her hissing, viperous wings,</p>
<p n="tr">turned toward her Stygian home, and took farewell</p>
<p n="tr">of upper air. Deep in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName> lies</p>
<p n="tr">a region mountain-girded, widely famed,</p>
<p n="tr">and known in olden songs from land to land:</p>
<p n="tr">the valley of Amsanctus; deep, dark shades</p>
<p n="tr">enclose it between forest-walls, whereby</p>
<p n="tr">through thunderous stony channel serpentines</p>
<p n="tr">a roaring fall. Here in a monstrous cave</p>
<p n="tr">are breathing-holes of hell, a vast abyss</p>
<p n="tr">where Acheron opes wide its noisome jaws:</p>
<p n="tr">in this Alecto plunged, concealing so</p>

<p n="tr">of earth and heaven felt the curse removed.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="572" unit="card"/>Forthwith the sovereign hands of Juno haste</p>

<p n="tr">and gray Galaesus' bleeding head. They call</p>
<p n="tr">just gods in heaven to Iook upon their wrong,</p>
<p n="tr">and bid Latinus see it. Turnus comes,</p>
<p n="tr">and, while the angry mob surveys the slain,</p>
<p n="tr">adds fury to the hour. Shall the land</p>
<p n="tr">have Trojan lords? Shall Phrygian marriages</p>
<p n="tr">debase our ancient, royal bloodand I</p>

<p n="tr">the men whose frenzied women-folk had held</p>
<p n="tr">bacchantic orgies in the pathless grove,</p>
<p n="tr">awed by Amata's name: these, gathering,</p>
<p n="tr">sued loud for war. Yea, all defied the signs</p>
<p n="tr">and venerable omens; all withstood</p>
<p n="tr">divine decrees, and clamored for revenge,</p>
<p n="tr">prompted by evil powers. They besieged</p>
<p n="tr">the house of King Latinus, shouting-loud</p>
<p n="tr">with emulous rage. But like a sea-girt rock</p>
<p n="tr">unmoved he stood; like sea-girt rock when surge</p>

<p n="tr">surround; it keeps a ponderous front of power,</p>
<p n="tr">though foaming cliffs around it vainly roar;</p>
<p n="tr">from its firm base the broken sea-weeds fall.</p>
<p n="tr">But when authority no whit could change</p>
<p n="tr">their counsels blind, and each event fulfilled</p>
<p n="tr">dread Juno's will, then with complaining prayer</p>
<p n="tr">the aged sire cried loud upon his gods</p>
<p n="tr">and on th' unheeding air: Alas, said he,</p>
<p n="tr">My doom is shipwreck, and the tempest bears</p>

<p n="tr">O Turnus! O abominable deed!</p>
<p n="tr">Avenging woes pursue thee; to deaf gods</p>

<p n="tr">Now was my time to rest. But as I come</p>
<p n="tr">close to my journey's end, thou spoilest me</p>

<p n="tr">For I remember Priam, when he came</p>
<p n="tr">to greet his sister, Queen Hesione,</p>
<p n="tr">in <placeName key="perseus,Salamis, Cyprus">Salamis</placeName>, and thence pursued his way</p>
  <p n="tr">to our cool uplands of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.</p>
<p n="tr">The bloom of tender boyhood then was mine,</p>
<p n="tr">and with a wide-eyed wonder I did view</p>
<p n="tr">those Teucrian lords, Laomedon's great heir,</p>
<p n="tr">and, towering highest in their goodly throng,</p>
<p n="tr">Anchises, whom my warm young heart desired</p>
<p n="tr">to speak with and to clasp his hand in mine.</p>
<p n="tr">So I approached, and joyful led him home</p>
<p n="tr">to Pheneus' olden wall. He gave me gifts</p>
<p n="tr">the day he bade adieu; a quiver rare</p>
<p n="tr">filled with good Lycian arrows, a rich cloak</p>
<p n="tr">inwove with thread of gold, and bridle reins</p>
<p n="tr">all golden, now to youthful Pallas given.</p>
<p n="tr">Therefore thy plea is granted, and my hand</p>
<p n="tr">here clasps in loyal amity with thine.</p>
<p n="tr">To-morrow at the sunrise thou shalt have</p>
<p n="tr">my tribute for the war, and go thy way</p>
<p n="tr">my glad ally. But now this festival,</p>
<p n="tr">whose solemn rite 't were impious to delay,</p>
<p n="tr">I pray thee celebrate, and bring with thee</p>
<p n="tr">well-omened looks and words. Allies we are!</p>
<p n="tr">Use this our sacred feast as if your own.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="card"/>So saying, he bade his followers renew</p>
<p n="tr">th' abandoned feast and wine; and placed each guest</p>
<p n="tr">on turf-built couch of green, most honoring</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas by a throne of maple fair</p>
<p n="tr">decked with a lion's pelt and flowing mane.</p>
<p n="tr">Then high-born pages, with the altar's priest,</p>
<p n="tr">bring on the roasted beeves and load the board</p>
<p n="tr">with baskets of fine bread; and wine they bring </p>
<p n="tr">of Ceres and of Bacchus gift and toil.</p>
<p n="tr">While good Aeneas and his Trojans share</p>
<p n="tr">the long whole ox and meats of sacrifice.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="184" unit="card"/>When hunger and its eager edge were gone,</p>
<p n="tr">Evander spoke: This votive holiday,</p>
<p n="tr">yon tables spread and altar so divine,</p>
<p n="tr">are not some superstition dark and vain,</p>
<p n="tr">that knows not the old gods, O Trojan King!</p>
<p n="tr">But as men saved from danger and great fear</p>
<p n="tr">this thankful sacrifice we pay. Behold,</p>
<p n="tr">yon huge rock, beetling from the mountain wall,</p>
<p n="tr">hung from the cliff above. How lone and bare</p>
<p n="tr">the hollowed mountain looks! How crag on crag</p>
<p n="tr">tumbled and tossed in huge confusion lie!</p>
<p n="tr">A cavern once it was, which ran deep down</p>
<p n="tr">into the darkness. There th' half-human shape</p>
<p n="tr">of Cacus made its hideous den, concealed</p>
<p n="tr">from sunlight and the day. The ground was wet</p>
<p n="tr">at all times with fresh gore; the portal grim</p>
<p n="tr">was hung about with heads of slaughtered men,</p>
<p n="tr">bloody and palea fearsome sight to see.</p>
<p n="tr">Vulcan begat this monster, which spewed forth</p>
<p n="tr">dark-fuming flames from his infernal throat,</p>
<p n="tr">and vast his stature seemed. But time and tide</p>
<p n="tr">brought to our prayers the advent of a god</p>
<p n="tr">to help us at our need. For Hercules,</p>
<p n="tr">divine avenger, came from laying low</p>
<p n="tr">three-bodied Geryon, whose spoils he wore</p>
<p n="tr">exultant, and with hands victorious drove</p>
<p n="tr">the herd of monster bulls, which pastured free</p>
<p n="tr">along our river-valley. Cacus gazed</p>
<p n="tr">in a brute frenzy, and left not untried</p>
<p n="tr">aught of bold crime or stratagem, but stole</p>
<p n="tr">four fine bulls as they fed, and heifers four,</p>
<p n="tr">all matchless; but, lest hoof-tracks point his way,</p>
<p n="tr">he dragged them cave-wards by the tails, confusing</p>
<p n="tr">the natural trail, and hid the stolen herd</p>
<p n="tr">in his dark den; and not a mark or sign</p>
<p n="tr">could guide the herdsmen to that cavern-door.</p>
<p n="tr">But after, when Amphitryon's famous son,</p>
<p n="tr">preparing to depart, would from the meads</p>
<p n="tr">goad forth the full-fed herd, his lingering bulls</p>
<p n="tr">roared loud, and by their lamentable cry</p>
<p n="tr">filled grove and hills with clamor of farewell:</p>
<p n="tr">one heifer from the mountain-cave lowed back</p>
<p n="tr">in answer, so from her close-guarded stall</p>
<p n="tr">foiling the monster's will. <milestone ed="p" n="219" unit="card"/>Then hadst thou seen</p>
<p n="tr">the wrath of Hercules in frenzy blaze</p>
<p n="tr">from his exasperate heart. His arms he seized,</p>
<p n="tr">his club of knotted oak, and climbed full-speed</p>
<p n="tr">the wind-swept hill. Now first our people saw</p>
<p n="tr">Cacus in fear, with panic in his eyes.</p>
<p n="tr">Swift to the black cave like a gale he flew,</p>
<p n="tr">his feet by terror winged. Scarce had he passed</p>
<p n="tr">the cavern door, and broken the big chains,</p>
<p n="tr">and dropped the huge rock which was pendent there</p>
<p n="tr">by Vulcan's well-wrought steel; scarce blocked and barred</p>
<p n="tr">the guarded gate: when there Tirynthius stood,</p>
<p n="tr">with heart aflame, surveying each approach,</p>
<p n="tr">rolling this way and that his wrathful eyes,</p>
<p n="tr">gnashing his teeth. Three times his ire surveyed</p>
<p n="tr">the slope of <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>; three times he stormed</p>
<p n="tr">the rock-built gate in vain; and thrice withdrew</p>
<p n="tr">to rest him in the vale. But high above</p>
<p n="tr">a pointed peak arose, sheer face of rock</p>
<p n="tr">on every side, which towered into view</p>
<p n="tr">from the long ridge above the vaulted cave,</p>
<p n="tr">fit haunt for birds of evil-boding wing.</p>
<p n="tr">This peak, which leftward toward the river leaned,</p>
<p n="tr">he smote upon its righthis utmost blow </p>
<p n="tr">breaking its bases Ioose; then suddenly</p>
<p n="tr">thrust at it: as he thrust, the thunder-sound</p>
<p n="tr">filled all the arching sky, the river's banks</p>
<p n="tr">asunder leaped, and <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> in alarm</p>
<p n="tr">reversed his flowing wave. So Cacus' lair</p>
<p n="tr">lay shelterless, and naked to the day</p>
<p n="tr">the gloomy caverns of his vast abode</p>
<p n="tr">stood open, deeply yawning, just as if</p>
<p n="tr">the riven earth should crack, and open wide</p>
<p n="tr">th' infernal world and fearful kingdoms pale,</p>
<p n="tr">which gods abhor; and to the realms on high</p>
<p n="tr">the measureless abyss should be laid bare,</p>
<p n="tr">and pale ghosts shrink before the entering sun.</p>
<p n="tr">Now upon Cacus, startled by the glare,</p>
<p n="tr">caged in the rocks and howling horribly,</p>
<p n="tr">Alcides hurled his weapons, raining down</p>
<p n="tr">all sorts of deadly missilestrunks of trees,</p>
<p n="tr">and monstrous boulders from the mountain torn.</p>
<p n="tr">But when the giant from his mortal strait</p>
<p n="tr">no refuge knew, he blew from his foul jaws</p>
<p n="tr">a storm of smokeincredible to tell </p>
<p n="tr">and with thick darkness blinding every eye,</p>
<p n="tr">concealed his cave, uprolling from below</p>
<p n="tr">one pitch-black night of mingled gloom and fire.</p>
<p n="tr">This would Alcides not endure, but leaped</p>
<p n="tr">headlong across the flames, where densest hung</p>
<p n="tr">the rolling smoke, and through the cavern surged</p>
<p n="tr">a drifting and impenetrable cloud.</p>
<p n="tr">With Cacus, who breathed unavailing flame,</p>
<p n="tr">he grappled in the dark, locked limb with limb,</p>
<p n="tr">and strangled him, till o'er the bloodless throat</p>
<p n="tr">the starting eyeballs stared.<milestone ed="p" n="262" unit="card"/>Then Hercules</p>
<p n="tr">burst wide the doorway of the sooty den,</p>
<p n="tr">and unto Heaven and all the people showed</p>
<p n="tr">the stolen cattle and the robber's crimes,</p>
<p n="tr">and dragged forth by the feet the shapeless corpse</p>
<p n="tr">of the foul monster slain. The people gazed</p>
<p n="tr">insatiate on the grewsome eyes, the breast</p>
<p n="tr">of bristling shag, the face both beast and man,</p>
<p n="tr">and that fire-blasted throat whence breathed no more</p>
<p n="tr">the extinguished flame. 'T is since that famous day</p>
<p n="tr">we celebrate this feast, and glad of heart</p>
<p n="tr">each generation keeps the holy time.</p>
<p n="tr">Potitius began the worship due,</p>
<p n="tr">and our Pinarian house is vowed to guard</p>
<p n="tr">the rites of Hercules. An altar fair</p>
<p n="tr">within this wood they raised; 't is called the Great,</p>
<p n="tr">and Ara Maxima its name shall be.</p>
<p n="tr">Come now, my warriors, and bind your brows</p>
<p n="tr">with garlands worthy of the gift of Heaven.</p>
<p n="tr">Lift high the cup in every thankful hand,</p>
<p n="tr">and praise our people's god with plenteous wine.</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke; and of the poplar's changeful sheen,</p>
<p n="tr">sacred to Hercules, wove him a wreath</p>
<p n="tr">to shade his silvered brow. The sacred cup</p>
<p n="tr">he raised in his right hand, while all the rest</p>
<p n="tr">called on the gods and pure libation poured.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="card"/>Soon from the travelling heavens the western star</p>
<p n="tr">glowed nearer, and Potitius led forth</p>
<p n="tr">the priest-procession, girt in ancient guise</p>
<p n="tr">with skins of beasts and carrying burning brands.</p>
<p n="tr">new feasts are spread, and altars heaped anew</p>
<p n="tr">with gifts and laden chargers. Then with song</p>
<p n="tr">the Salian choir surrounds the blazing shrine,</p>
<p n="tr">their foreheads wreathed with poplar. Here the youth,</p>
<p n="tr">the elders yonder, in proud anthem sing</p>
<p n="tr">the glory and the deeds of Hercules:</p>
<p n="tr">how first he strangled with strong infant hand</p>
<p n="tr">two serpents, Juno's plague; what cities proud,</p>
<p n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and Oechalia, his famous war</p>
<p n="tr">in pieces broke; what labors numberless</p>
<p n="tr">as King Eurystheus' bondman he endured, </p>
<p n="tr">by cruel Juno's will. Thou, unsubdued,</p>
<p n="tr">didst strike the twy-formed, cloud-bred centaurs down,</p>
<p n="tr">Pholus and tall Hylaeus. Thou hast slain</p>
<p n="tr">the Cretan horror, and the lion huge</p>
<p n="tr">beneath the Nemean crag. At sight of thee</p>
<p n="tr">the Stygian region quailed, and Cerberus,</p>
<p n="tr">crouching o'er half-picked bones in gory cave.</p>
<p n="tr">Nothing could bid thee fear. Typhoeus towered</p>
<p n="tr">in his colossal Titan-panoply</p>
<p n="tr">o'er thee in vain; nor did thy cunning fail</p>
<p n="tr">when Lema's wonder-serpent round thee drew</p>
<p n="tr">its multudinous head. Hail, Jove's true son!</p>
<p n="tr">New glory to the gods above, come down,</p>
<p n="tr">and these thine altars and thy people bless!</p>
<p n="tr">Such hymns they chanted, telling oft the tale</p>
<p n="tr">of Cacus' cave and blasting breath of fire:</p>
<p n="tr">while hills and sacred grove the note prolong.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="306" unit="card"/>Such worship o'er, all take the homeward way</p>
<p n="tr">back to the town. The hospitable King,</p>
<p n="tr">though bowed with weight of years, kept at his side</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas and his son, and as they fared,</p>
<p n="tr">with various discourse beguiled the way.</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas scanned with quick-admiring eyes</p>
<p n="tr">the region wide, and lingered with delight</p>
<p n="tr">now here, now there, inquiring eagerly</p>
<p n="tr">of each proud monument of heroes gone.</p>
<p n="tr">Then King Evander, he who builded first</p>
  <p n="tr">On <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName>, spoke thus: These groves erewhile</p>
<p n="tr">their native nymphs and fauns enjoyed, with men</p>
<p n="tr">from trees engendered and stout heart of oak.</p>
<p n="tr">Nor laws nor arts they knew; nor how to tame</p>
<p n="tr">burls to the yoke, nor fill great barns with store</p>
<p n="tr">and hoard the gathered grain; but rudely fared</p>
<p n="tr">on wild fruits and such food as hunters find.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Saturn from Olympian realms came down,</p>
<p n="tr">in flight from Jove's dread arms, his sceptre lost,</p>
<p n="tr">and he an exiled King. That savage race</p>
<p n="tr">he gathered from the mountain slopes; and gave</p>
<p n="tr">wise laws and statutes; so that latent land</p>
<p n="tr">was <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, hid land, where he hid so long.</p>
<p n="tr">The golden centuries by legends told</p>
<p n="tr">were under that good King, whose equal sway</p>
<p n="tr">untroubled peace to all his peoples gave.</p>
<p n="tr">But after slow decline arrived an age</p>
<p n="tr">degenerate and of a darker hue,</p>
<p n="tr">prone to insensate war and greed of gain.</p>
<p n="tr">Then came Sicanian and Ausonian tribes,</p>
<p n="tr">and oft the land of Saturn lost its name.</p>
<p n="tr">New chieftains rose, and Thybris, giant King</p>
<p n="tr">and violent, from whom th' Italians named</p>
<p n="tr">the flooding <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, which was called no more</p>
<p n="tr">the Albula, its true and ancient style.</p>
<p n="tr">Myself, in exile from my fatherland</p>
<p n="tr">sailing uncharted seas, was guided here</p>
<p n="tr">by all-disposing Chance and iron laws</p>
<p n="tr">of Destiny. With prophecy severe</p>
<p n="tr">Carmentis, my nymph-mother, thrust me on,</p>
<p n="tr">warned by Apollo's word. <milestone ed="p" n="337" unit="card"/>He scarce had said,</p>
<p n="tr">when near their path he showed an altar fair</p>
<p n="tr">and the Carmental gate, where Romans see</p>
<p n="tr">memorial of Carmentis, nymph divine,</p>
<p n="tr">the prophetess of fate, who first foretold</p>
<p n="tr">what honors on Aeneas' sons should fall</p>
<p n="tr">and lordly Pallanteum, where they dwell.</p>
<p n="tr">Next the vast grove was seen, where Romulus</p>
<p n="tr">ordained inviolable sanctuary;</p>
<p n="tr">then the Lupercal under its cold crag,</p>
<p n="tr">Wolf-hill, where old Arcadians revered</p>
<p n="tr">their wolf-god, the Lycaean Pan. Here too</p>
<p n="tr">the grove of Argiletum, sacred name,</p>
<p n="tr">where good Evander told the crime and death</p>
<p n="tr">of Argus, his false guest. From this they climbed</p>
<p n="tr">the steep Tarpeian hill, the Capitol,</p>
<p n="tr">all gold to-day, but then a tangled wild</p>
<p n="tr">of thorny woodland. Even then the place</p>
<p n="tr">woke in the rustics a religious awe,</p>
<p n="tr">and bade them fear and tremble at the view</p>
<p n="tr">of that dread rock and grove. This leafy wood,</p>
<p n="tr">which crowns the hill-top, is the favored seat</p>
<p n="tr">of some great god, said he, but of his name</p>
<p n="tr">we know not surely. The Arcadians say</p>
<p n="tr">jove's dread right hand here visibly appears</p>
<p n="tr">to shake his aegis in the darkening storm,</p>
<p n="tr">the clouds compelling. Yonder rise in view</p>
<p n="tr">two strongholds with dismantled walls, which now</p>
<p n="tr">are but a memory of great heroes gone:</p>
<p n="tr">one father Janus built, and Saturn one;</p>
<p n="tr">their names, <placeName key="tgn,6005278">Saturnia</placeName> and Janiculum.</p>
<p n="tr">'Mid such good parley to the house they came</p>
<p n="tr">of King Evander, unadorned and plain,</p>
<p n="tr">whence herds of browsing cattle could be seen</p>
<p n="tr">ranging the Forum, and loud-bellowing</p>
<p n="tr">in proud Carinae. As they entered there,</p>
<p n="tr">Behold, said he, the threshold that received</p>
<p n="tr">Alcides in his triumph! This abode</p>
<p n="tr">he made his own. Dare, O illustrious guest,</p>
<p n="tr">to scorn the pomp of power. Shape thy soul</p>
<p n="tr">to be a god's fit follower. Enter here,</p>
<p n="tr">and free from pride our frugal welcome share.</p>
<p n="tr">So saying, 'neath his roof-tree scant and low</p>
<p n="tr">he led the great Aeneas, offering him</p>
<p n="tr">a couch of leaves with Libyan bear-skin spread.</p>
<p n="tr">Now night drew near, enfolding the wide world</p>
<p n="tr">in shadowy wings. <milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="card"/>But Venus, sore disturbed,</p>
<p n="tr">vexed not unwisely her maternal breast,</p>
<p n="tr">fearing Laurentum's menace and wild stir</p>
<p n="tr">of obstinate revolt, and made her plea</p>
<p n="tr">to Vulcan in their nuptial bower of gold,</p>
<p n="tr">outbreathing in the music of her words</p>
<p n="tr">celestial love: When warring <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> kings</p>
<p n="tr">brought ruin on <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s sacred citadel</p>
<p n="tr">and ramparts soon to sink in hostile flames,</p>
<p n="tr">I asked not thee to help that hopeless woe,</p>
<p n="tr">nor craved thy craft and power. For, dearest lord,</p>
<p n="tr">I would not tax in vain shine arduous toil,</p>
<p n="tr">though much to Priam's children I was bound,</p>
<p n="tr">and oft to see Aeneas burdened sore</p>
<p n="tr">I could but weep. But now by will of Jove</p>
<p n="tr">he has found foothold in Rutulian lands.</p>
<p n="tr">Therefore I come at last with lowly suit</p>
<p n="tr">before a godhead I adore, and pray</p>
<p n="tr">for gift of arms,a mother for her son.</p>
<p n="tr">Thou wert not unrelenting to the tears</p>
<p n="tr">of Nereus' daughter or Tithonus' bride.</p>
<p n="tr">Behold what tribes conspire, what cities strong</p>
<p n="tr">behind barred gates now make the falchion keen</p>
<p n="tr">to ruin and blot out both me and mine!</p>
<p n="tr">So spake the goddess, as her arms of snow</p>
<p n="tr">around her hesitating spouse she threw</p>
<p n="tr">in tender, close embrace. He suddenly</p>
<p n="tr">knew the familiar fire, and o'er his frame</p>
<p n="tr">its wonted ardor unresisted ran,</p>
<p n="tr">swift as the glittering shaft of thunder cleaves</p>
<p n="tr">the darkened air and on from cloud to cloud</p>

<p n="tr">felt what her beauty and her guile could do;</p>
<p n="tr">as, thralled by love unquenchable, her spouse</p>
<p n="tr">thus answered fair: Why wilt thou labor so</p>
<p n="tr">with far-fetched pleas? my goddess, hast thou lost</p>
<p n="tr">thy faith in me? Had such a prayer been shine,</p>
<p n="tr">I could have armed the Teucrians. Neither Jove</p>
<p n="tr">nor Destiny had grudged ten added years</p>

<p n="tr">thou hast a war in hand, and if thy heart</p>

<p n="tr">molten alloy or welded iron can,</p>
<p n="tr">whate'er my roaring forge and flames achieve,</p>
<p n="tr">I offer thee. No more in anxious prayer</p>
<p n="tr">distrust thy beauty's power. So saying, he gave</p>

<p n="tr">not far from a Sicilian headland lies,</p>

<p n="tr">above a vast vault, which the Cyclops' skill</p>

<p n="tr">A mighty shield took shape, its single orb</p>
<p n="tr">sufficient to withstand the gathered shock</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="454" unit="card"/>While thus the Lemnian god his labor sped</p>
<p n="tr">in far Aeolian isle, the cheerful morn</p>
<p n="tr">with voice of swallows round his lowly eaves</p>
<p n="tr">summoned Evander. From his couch arose</p>
<p n="tr">the royal sire, and o'er his aged frame</p>
<p n="tr">a tunic threw, tying beneath his feet</p>
<p n="tr">the Tuscan sandals: an Arcadian sword,</p>
<p n="tr">girt at his left, was over one shoulder slung,</p>
<p n="tr">his cloak of panther trailing from behind.</p>
<p n="tr">A pair of watch-dogs from the lofty door</p>
<p n="tr">ran close, their lord attending, as he sought</p>
<p n="tr">his guest Aeneas; for his princely soul</p>
<p n="tr">remembered faithfully his former word,</p>
<p n="tr">and promised gift. Aeneas with like mind</p>
<p n="tr">was stirring early. King Evander's son</p>
<p n="tr">Pallas was at his side; Achates too</p>
<p n="tr">accompanied his friend. All these conjoin</p>
<p n="tr">in hand-clasp and good-morrow, taking seats</p>
<p n="tr">in midcourt of the house, and give the hour</p>
<p n="tr">to converse unrestrained. First spoke the King:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="card"/>Great leader of the Teucrians, while thy life</p>
<p n="tr">in safety stands, I call not Trojan power</p>
<p n="tr">vanquished or fallen. But to help thy war</p>
<p n="tr">my small means match not thy redoubled name.</p>
<p n="tr">Yon Tuscan river is my bound. That way</p>
<p n="tr">Rutulia thrusts us hard and chafes our wall</p>
<p n="tr">with loud, besieging arms. But I propose</p>
<p n="tr">to league with thee a numerous array</p>
<p n="tr">of kings and mighty tribes, which fortune strange</p>
<p n="tr">now brings to thy defence. Thou comest here</p>
<p n="tr">because the Fates intend. Not far from ours</p>
<p n="tr">a city on an ancient rock is seen,</p>
<p n="tr">Agylla, which a warlike Lydian clan</p>
<p n="tr">built on the Tuscan hills. It prospered well</p>
<p n="tr">for many a year, then under the proud yoke</p>
<p n="tr">of King Mezentius it came and bore</p>
<p n="tr">his cruel sway. Why tell the loathsome deeds</p>
<p n="tr">and crimes unspeakable the despot wrought?</p>
<p n="tr">May Heaven requite them on his impious head</p>
<p n="tr">and on his children! For he used to chain</p>
<p n="tr">dead men to living, hand on hand was laid</p>
<p n="tr">and face on face,torment incredible!</p>
<p n="tr">Till, locked in blood-stained, horrible embrace,</p>
<p n="tr">a lingering death they found. But at the last</p>
<p n="tr">his people rose in furious despair,</p>
<p n="tr">and while he blasphemously raged, assailed</p>
<p n="tr">his life and throne, cut down his guards</p>
<p n="tr">and fired his regal dwellings; he, the while,</p>
<p n="tr">escaped immediate death and fied away</p>
<p n="tr">to the Rutulian land, to find defence</p>
<p n="tr">in Turnus hospitality. To-day</p>
<p n="tr">Etruria, to righteous anger stirred,</p>
<p n="tr">demands with urgent arms her guilty King.</p>
<p n="tr">To their large host, Aeneas, I will give</p>
<p n="tr">an added strength, thyself. For yonder shores</p>
<p n="tr">re-echo with the tumult and the cry</p>
<p n="tr">of ships in close array; their eager lords</p>
<p n="tr">are clamoring for battle. But the song</p>
<p n="tr">of the gray omen-giver thus declares</p>
<p n="tr">their destiny: O goodly princes born</p>
<p n="tr">of old Maeonian lineage! Ye that are</p>
<p n="tr">the bloom and glory of an ancient race,</p>
<p n="tr">whom just occasions now and noble rage</p>
<p n="tr">enflame against Mezentius your foe,</p>
<p n="tr">it is decreed that yonder nation proud</p>
<p n="tr">shall never submit to chiefs Italian-born.</p>
<p n="tr">Seek ye a king from far! So in the field</p>
<p n="tr">inert and fearful lies Etruria's force,</p>
<p n="tr">disarmed by oracles. Their Tarchon sent</p>
<p n="tr">envoys who bore a sceptre and a crown</p>
<p n="tr">even to me, and prayed I should assume</p>
<p n="tr">the sacred emblems of Etruria's king,</p>
<p n="tr">and lead their host to war. But unto me</p>
<p n="tr">cold, sluggish age, now barren and outworn,</p>
<p n="tr">denies new kingdoms, and my slow-paced powers</p>
<p n="tr">run to brave deeds no more. Nor could I urge</p>
<p n="tr">my son, who by his Sabine mother's line</p>
<p n="tr">is half Italian-born. Thyself art he, </p>
<p n="tr">whose birth illustrious and manly prime </p>

<p n="tr">Aeneas is the dearest wish to-night</p>

<p n="tr">In this breast also is a heart which knows</p>

<p n="tr">But if, as oft in doubtful deeds befalls,</p>
<p n="tr">some stroke of chance, or will divine, should turn</p>
<p n="tr">to adverse, 't is my fondest prayer that thou</p>

<p n="tr">watch over <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, ye surely had no mind</p>
<p n="tr">to blot out Teucria's name, when ye bestowed</p>
<p n="tr">such courage on young hearts, and bade them be</p>
<p n="tr">so steadfast and so leal. Joyful he clasped</p>
<p n="tr">their hands in his, and on their shoulders leaned,</p>
<p n="tr">his aged cheek and visage wet with tears.</p>
<p n="tr">What reward worthy of such actions fair,</p>
<p n="tr">dear heroes, could be given? Your brightest prize</p>
<p n="tr">will come from Heaven and your own hearts. The rest</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas will right soon bestow; nor will</p>
<p n="tr">Ascanius, now in youth's unblemished prime,</p>
<p n="tr">ever forget your praise. Forthwith replied</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas' son, By all our household gods,</p>
<p n="tr">by great Assaracus, and every shrine</p>
<p n="tr">of venerable Vesta, I confide</p>
<p n="tr">my hopes, my fortunes, and all future weal</p>
<p n="tr">to your heroic hearts. O, bring me back</p>
<p n="tr">my father! Set him in these eyes once more!</p>
<p n="tr">That day will tears be dry; and I will give</p>
<p n="tr">two silver wine-cups graven and o'erlaid</p>
<p n="tr">with clear-cut figures, which my father chose</p>
<p n="tr">out of despoiled Arisbe; also two</p>
<p n="tr">full talents of pure gold, and tripods twain,</p>
<p n="tr">and ancient wine-bowl, Tyrian Dido's token.</p>
<p n="tr">But if indeed our destiny shall be</p>
<p n="tr">to vanquish <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> in prosperous war,</p>
<p n="tr">to seize the sceptre and divide the spoil, </p>
<p n="tr">saw you that steed of Turnus and the arms</p>
<p n="tr">in which he rode, all golden? That same steed,</p>
<p n="tr">that glittering shield and haughty crimson crest</p>
<p n="tr">I will reserve thee, e'er the lots are cast,</p>
<p n="tr">and, Nisus, they are thine. Hereto my sire</p>
<p n="tr">will add twelve captive maids of beauty rare,</p>
<p n="tr">and slaves in armor; last, thou hast the fields</p>
<p n="tr">which now Latinus holds. But as for thee,</p>
<p n="tr">to whom my youth but binds me closer still,</p>
<p n="tr">thee, kingly boy, my whole heart makes my own,</p>
<p n="tr">and through all changeful fortune we shall be</p>
<p n="tr">inseparable peers: nor will I seek</p>
<p n="tr">renown and glory, or in peace or war,</p>
<p n="tr">forgetting thee: but trust thee from this day</p>
<p n="tr">in deed and word. To him in answer spoke</p>
<p n="tr">euryalus, O, may no future show</p>
<p n="tr">this heart unworthy thy heroic call!</p>
<p n="tr">And may our fortune ever prosperous prove,</p>
<p n="tr">not adverse. But I now implore of thee</p>
<p n="tr">a single boon worth all beside. I have</p>
<p n="tr">a mother, from the venerated line</p>
<p n="tr">of Priam sprung, whom not the Trojan shore</p>
<p n="tr">nor King Acestes' city could detain,</p>
<p n="tr">alas! from following me. I leave her now</p>
<p n="tr">without farewell; nor is her love aware</p>
<p n="tr">of my supposed peril. For I swear</p>
<p n="tr">by darkness of this night and thy right hand,</p>
<p n="tr">that all my courage fails me if I see</p>
<p n="tr">a mother's tears. O, therefore, I implore,</p>
<p n="tr">be thou her sorrow's comfort and sustain</p>
<p n="tr">her solitary day. Such grace from thee</p>
<p n="tr">equip me for my war, and I shall face</p>
<p n="tr">with braver heart whatever fortune brings.</p>
<p n="tr">With sudden sorrow thrilled, the veteran lords</p>
<p n="tr">of Teucria showed their tears. But most of all</p>
<p n="tr">such likeness of his own heart's filial love</p>
<p n="tr">on fair Iulus moved, and thus he spoke:</p>
<p n="tr">Promise thyself what fits thy generous deeds.</p>
<p n="tr">Thy mother shall be mine, Creusa's name</p>
<p n="tr">alone not hers; nor is the womb unblest</p>
<p n="tr">that bore a child like thee. Whate'er success</p>
<p n="tr">may follow, I make oath immutable</p>
<p n="tr">by my own head, on which my father swore,</p>
<p n="tr">that all I promise thee of gift or praise</p>
<p n="tr">if home thou comest triumphing, shall be</p>
<p n="tr">the glory of thy mother and thy kin.</p>
<p n="tr">Weeping he spoke, and from his shoulder drew</p>
<p n="tr">the golden sword, well-wrought and wonderful,</p>
<p n="tr">which once in Crete Lycaon's cunning made</p>
<p n="tr">and sheathed in ivory. On Nisus then</p>
<p n="tr">Mnestheus bestowed a shaggy mantle torn</p>
<p n="tr">from a slain lion; good Aletes gave</p>
<p n="tr">exchange of crested helms. In such array</p>
<p n="tr">they hastened forth; and all the princely throng,</p>
<p n="tr">young men and old, ran with them to the gates,</p>
<p n="tr">praying all gods to bless. Iulus then,</p>
<p n="tr">a fair youth, but of grave, heroic soul</p>
<p n="tr">beyond his years, gave them in solemn charge</p>
<p n="tr">full many a message for his sire, but these</p>
<p n="tr">the hazard of wild winds soon scattered far,</p>
<p n="tr">and flung them fruitless on the darkening storm.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="314" unit="card"/>Forth through the moat they climb, and steal away</p>
<p n="tr">through midnight shades, to where their foemen lie</p>
<p n="tr">encamped in arms; of whom, before these fall,</p>
<p n="tr">a host shall die. Along the turf were seen,</p>
<p n="tr">laid low in heavy slumber and much wine,</p>
<p n="tr">a prostrate troop; the horseless chariots</p>
<p n="tr">stood tilted on the shore, 'twixt rein and wheel</p>
<p n="tr">the drivers dozed, wine-cups and idle swords</p>
<p n="tr">strewn round them without heed. The first to speak</p>
<p n="tr">was Nisus. Look, Euryalus, he cried,</p>
<p n="tr">Now boldly strike. The hour to do the deed</p>
<p n="tr">is here, the path this way. Keep wide-eyed watch</p>
<p n="tr">that no man smite behind us. I myself</p>
<p n="tr">will mow the mighty fieid, and lead thee on</p>
<p n="tr">in a wide swath of slaughter. With this word</p>
<p n="tr">he shut his lips; and hurled him with his sword</p>
<p n="tr">on haughty Rhamnes, who lay propped at ease</p>
<p n="tr">on pillows huge, and from his heaving breast</p>
<p n="tr">poured slumber loud: of royal stem was he</p>
<p n="tr">and honored of King Turnus for his skill</p>
<p n="tr">in augury; yet could no augur's charm</p>
<p n="tr">that bloody stroke forefend. And Nisus slew</p>
<p n="tr">three slaves near by, that lay in reckless sleep</p>
<p n="tr">upon their spears; then him that bore the shield</p>
<p n="tr">of Remus, then the driver of his car</p>
<p n="tr">close to the horses caught; his sword cut through</p>
<p n="tr">their prostrate necks; then their great master's head</p>
<p n="tr">he lifted high, and left decapitate</p>
<p n="tr">the huge corpse spilling forth its crimson gore</p>
<p n="tr">o'er couch and ground. Like stroke on Lamus fell</p>
<p n="tr">and Lamyrus, with young Serranus, who</p>
<p n="tr">had gamed the midnight through and sleeping lay,</p>
<p n="tr">his fair young body to the wine-god given;</p>
<p n="tr">but happier now had that long-revelling night</p>
<p n="tr">been merry till the dawn! Thus round full folds</p>
<p n="tr">of sheep a famished lion fiercely prowls;</p>
<p n="tr">mad hunger moves him; he devours and rends</p>
<p n="tr">with bloody, roaring mouth, the feeble flock</p>
<p n="tr">that trembles and is dumb. Nor was the sword</p>
<p n="tr">of fair Euryalus less fatal found;</p>
<p n="tr">but fiercely raging on his path of death,</p>
<p n="tr">he pressed on through a base and nameless throng,</p>
<p n="tr">Rhoetus, Herbesus, Fadus, Abaris;</p>
<p n="tr">surprising all save Rhoetus, who awake</p>
<p n="tr">saw every stroke, and crouched in craven fear</p>
<p n="tr">behind a mighty wine-bowl; but not less</p>
<p n="tr">clean through his bare breast as he started forth</p>
<p n="tr">the youth thrust home his sword, then drew it back</p>
<p n="tr">death-dripping, while the bursting purple stream</p>
<p n="tr">of life outflowed, with mingling blood and wine.</p>
<p n="tr">Then, flushed with stealthy slaughter, he crept near</p>
<p n="tr">the followers of Messapus, where he saw</p>
<p n="tr">their camp-fire dying down, and tethered steeds</p>
<p n="tr">upon the meadow feeding. Nisus then</p>
<p n="tr">knew the hot lust of slaughter had swept on </p>
<p n="tr">too far, and cried, Hold off! For, lo,</p>
<p n="tr">the monitory dawn is nigh. Revenge</p>
<p n="tr">has fed us to the full. We have achieved</p>
<p n="tr">clean passage through the foe. Full many a prize</p>
<p n="tr">was left untaken: princely suits of mail</p>
<p n="tr">enwrought with silver pure, huge drinking-bowls,</p>
<p n="tr">and broideries fair. Yet grasped Euryalus</p>
<p n="tr">the blazonry at Rhamnes' corselet hung,</p>
<p n="tr">and belt adorned with gold: which were a gift</p>
<p n="tr">to Remulus of <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName> from the store</p>
<p n="tr">of opulent Caedicus, who sued from far</p>
<p n="tr">to be a friend; and these in death he gave</p>
<p n="tr">to his son's son, who slain in battle fell,</p>
<p n="tr">and proud Rutulians seized them with the spoil.</p>
<p n="tr">Euryalus about his shoulder strong</p>
<p n="tr">this booty slungunprofitable gain! </p>
<p n="tr">and fitted on a gorgeous, crested helm</p>
<p n="tr">which once Messapus wore. So from the camp,</p>
<p n="tr">escaping danger, the two champions ran.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="367" unit="card"/>But horsemen from the Latin city sent</p>
<p n="tr">to join the serried legions of the plain</p>
<p n="tr">had come at Turnus' call, three hundred strong</p>
<p n="tr">all bearing shields, and under the command</p>
<p n="tr">of Volscens. Nigh the camp and walls they drew;</p>
<p n="tr">and soon they spied upon the leftward path</p>
<p n="tr">th' heroic pair, where in dim shades of night</p>
<p n="tr">the helmet of Euryalus betrayed</p>
<p n="tr">the heedless boy, and with a glancing beam</p>
<p n="tr">flashed on the foe. Nor was it seen in vain.</p>
<p n="tr">Loud from the line the voice of Volscens called:</p>
<p n="tr">Stand, gentlemen! What business brings you here?</p>
<p n="tr">Whose your allegiance? Whither speed so fast?</p>
<p n="tr">No answer gave they save to fly in haste</p>
<p n="tr">to cover of the forest and deep gloom</p>
<p n="tr">of the defensive night. The horsemen then</p>
<p n="tr">blocked every crossway known, and, scattering wide,</p>
<p n="tr">kept sentry at the entrance. The great wood</p>
<p n="tr">was all of tangled brush and blinding shade</p>
<p n="tr">of flex-boughs. Impenetrable thorns</p>
<p n="tr">had thickly overgrown, and seldom showed</p>
<p n="tr">a pathway through the maze. Euryalus,</p>
<p n="tr">by the black branches and his ponderous spoil</p>
<p n="tr">impeded, groped along in fearful doubt,</p>
<p n="tr">deceived and quite astray. Nisus his friend</p>
<p n="tr">had quit him, and incautiously had forced</p>
<p n="tr">a sally through the close-encircling foe,</p>
<p n="tr">into that region which should after bear</p>
<p n="tr">the name of Albaa rude shelter then</p>
<p n="tr">for King Latinus' herds. He stayed him there</p>
<p n="tr">and looked, but vainly, for the comrade gone.</p>
<p n="tr">Euryalus, ill-fated boy! he cried,</p>
<p n="tr">Where have I lost thee in the pathless wild?</p>
<p n="tr">How find thee? How retrace the blinding maze</p>
<p n="tr">of yonder treacherous wood? Yet ere he said,</p>
<p n="tr">on his own path he turns him back, and scans</p>
<p n="tr">his own light footprints through the tangled thorn,</p>
<p n="tr">so dark and still. But suddenly he hears</p>
<p n="tr">the tread of horses, with confusing din</p>
<p n="tr">and tumult of pursuit. Nor was it long</p>
<p n="tr">he tarried ere upon his anguished ear</p>
<p n="tr">smote a great cry: and, lo! Euryalus,</p>
<p n="tr">trapped by the dark night, the deceptive ground,</p>
<p n="tr">faced the whole onset, and fell back o'erwhelmed</p>
<p n="tr">by a loud mob of foes, while his sole sword</p>
<p n="tr">tried many a thrust in vain. O, what defence</p>
<p n="tr">may Nisus bring? With what audacious arms</p>
<p n="tr">his chosen comrade save? Shall he make bare</p>
<p n="tr">his dying breast to all their swords, and run</p>
<p n="tr">to honorable death that bloody way?</p>
<p n="tr">he swung his spear with lifted arm, then looked</p>
<p n="tr">to the still moon, in heaven, and thus implored:</p>
<p n="tr">O goddess, aid me in my evil case.</p>
<p n="tr">O glory of the stars, Latona's child!</p>
<p n="tr">O guardian of groves, if in my name</p>
<p n="tr">my father Hyrtacus made offerings</p>
<p n="tr">on burning altars, if my own right hand,</p>
<p n="tr">successful in the chase, ere hung its gift</p>
<p n="tr">beneath thy dome or on thy sacred wall,</p>
<p n="tr">grant me yon troop to scatter. Guide my spear</p>
<p n="tr">along its path in air. He spoke, and hurled</p>
<p n="tr">with all his gathered strength the shaft of steel.</p>
<p n="tr">the swift spear clove the shades of night, and struck</p>
<p n="tr">full in the back of Sulmo, where it split,</p>
<p n="tr">but tore through to his very heart. The breast</p>
<p n="tr">poured forth life's glowing stream, and he, o'erthrown</p>
<p n="tr">lay cold in death, while his huge, heaving sides</p>
<p n="tr">gave lingering throes. The men about him stared </p>
<p n="tr">this way and that. But Nisus, fiercer still,</p>
<p n="tr">poised level with his ear a second shaft,</p>
<p n="tr">and, while the foeman paused, the whizzing spear </p>
<p n="tr">straight through the brows of Tagus drove, and clung</p>
<p n="tr">deep in the cloven brain. <milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="card"/>In frenzy rose</p>
<p n="tr">Volscens, but nowhere could espy what hand</p>
<p n="tr">the shaft had hurled, nor whither his wild rage</p>
<p n="tr">could make reply. But thou, he cried, shalt feed</p>
<p n="tr">with thy hot blood my honor and revenge</p>
<p n="tr">for both the slain. Then with a sword unsheathed</p>
<p n="tr">upon Euryalus he fell. Loud shrieked</p>
<p n="tr">Nisus, of reason reft, who could not bear</p>
<p n="tr">such horror, nor in sheltering gloom of night</p>
<p n="tr">longer abide: 'T is I, 't is I! he said.</p>
<p n="tr">look on the man who slew them! Draw on me</p>
<p n="tr">your swords, Rutulians! The whole stratagem</p>
<p n="tr">was mine, mine only, and the lad ye slay</p>
<p n="tr">dared not, and could not. O, by Heaven above</p>
<p n="tr">and by the all-beholding stars I swear,</p>
<p n="tr">he did but love his hapless friend too well.</p>
<p n="tr">But while he spoke, the furious-thrusting sword</p>
<p n="tr">had pierced the tender body, and run through</p>
<p n="tr">the bosom white as snow. Euryalus</p>
<p n="tr">sank prone in death; upon his goodly limbs</p>
<p n="tr">the life-blood ran unstopped, and low inclined</p>
<p n="tr">the drooping head; as when some purpled flower,</p>
<p n="tr">cut by the ploughshare, dies, or poppies proud</p>
<p n="tr">with stem forlorn their ruined beauty bow</p>
<p n="tr">before the pelting storm. Then Nisus flew</p>
<p n="tr">straight at his foes; but in their throng would find</p>
<p n="tr">Volscens alone, for none but Volscens stayed:</p>
<p n="tr">they gathered thickly round and grappled him</p>
<p n="tr">in shock of steel with steel. But on he plunged,</p>
<p n="tr">swinging in ceaseless circles round his head</p>
<p n="tr">his lightning-sword, and thrust it through the face</p>
<p n="tr">of shrieking Volscens, with his own last breath</p>
<p n="tr">striking his foeman down; then cast himself</p>
<p n="tr">upon his fallen comrade's breast; and there,</p>
<p n="tr">stabbed through, found tranquil death and sure repose. </p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="446" unit="card"/>Heroic pair and blest! If aught I sing</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="card"/>A tower was there, well-placed and looming large,</p>
<p n="tr">with many a lofty bridge, which desperately</p>
<p n="tr">th' Italians strove to storm, and strangely plied</p>
<p n="tr">besieging enginery to cast it down:</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojans hurled back stones, or, standing close,</p>
<p n="tr">flung through the loopholes a swift shower of spears.</p>
<p n="tr">But Turnus launched a firebrand, and pierced</p>
<p n="tr">the wooden wall with flame, which in the wind</p>
<p n="tr">leaped larger, and devoured from floor to floor,</p>
<p n="tr">burning each beam away. The trembling guards</p>
<p n="tr">sought flight in vain; and while they crowded close</p>
<p n="tr">into the side unkindled yet, the tower</p>
<p n="tr">bowed its whole weight and fell, with sudden crash</p>
<p n="tr">that thundered through the sky. Along the ground</p>
<p n="tr">half dead the warriors fell (the crushing mass</p>
<p n="tr">piled over them) by their own pointed spears</p>
<p n="tr">pierced to the heart, or wounded mortally</p>
<p n="tr">by cruel splinters of the wreck. Two men,</p>
<p n="tr">Helenor one, and Lyeus at his side,</p>
<p n="tr">alone get free. Helenor of the twain</p>
<p n="tr">was a mere youth; the slave Lycymnia</p>
<p n="tr">bore him in secret to the Lydian King,</p>
<p n="tr">and, arming him by stealth, had sent away</p>
<p n="tr">to serve the Trojan cause. One naked sword</p>
<p n="tr">for arms had he, and on his virgin shield</p>
<p n="tr">no blazon of renown; but when he saw</p>
<p n="tr">the hosts of Turnus front him, and the lines</p>
<p n="tr">this way and that of Latins closing round, </p>
<p n="tr">as a fierce, forest-creature, brought to bay</p>
<p n="tr">in circling pack of huntsmen, shows its teeth</p>
<p n="tr">against the naked spears, and scorning death</p>
<p n="tr">leaps upward on the javelins,even so,</p>
<p n="tr">not loth to die, the youthful soldier flew</p>
<p n="tr">straight at the centre of his foes, and where</p>
<p n="tr">the shining swords looked thickest, there he sprung.</p>
<p n="tr">But Lyeus, swifter-footed, forced his way</p>
<p n="tr">past the opposing spears and made escape</p>
<p n="tr">far as the ciity-wall, where he would fain</p>
<p n="tr">clutch at the coping and climb up to clasp</p>
<p n="tr">some friend above: but Turnus, spear in hand,</p>
<p n="tr">had hotly followed, and exulting loud</p>
<p n="tr">thus taunted him, Hadst thou the hope, rash fool,</p>
<p n="tr">beyond this grasp to fly? So, as he clung,</p>
<p n="tr">he tore him down; and with him broke and fell</p>
<p n="tr">a huge piece of the wall: not otherwise</p>
<p n="tr">a frail hare, or a swan of snow-white wing,</p>
<p n="tr">is clutched in eagle-talons, when the bird</p>
<p n="tr">of Jove soars skyward with his prey; or tender lamb</p>
<p n="tr">from bleating mother and the broken fold</p>
<p n="tr">is stolen by the wolf of Mars. Wild shouts</p>
<p n="tr">on every side resound. In closer siege</p>
<p n="tr">the foe press on, and heap the trenches full,</p>
<p n="tr">or hurl hot-flaming torches at the towers.</p>
<p n="tr">Ilioneus with mountain-mass of stone</p>
<p n="tr">struck down Lucetius, as he crept with fire</p>
<p n="tr">too near the city-gate. Emathion fell</p>
<p n="tr">by Liger's hand, and Corynteus' death</p>
<p n="tr">Asilas dealt: one threw the javelin well;</p>
<p n="tr">th' insidious arrow was Asilas' skill.</p>
<p n="tr">Ortygius was slain by Caeneus, then</p>
<p n="tr">victorious Geneus fell by Turnus' ire.</p>
<p n="tr">Then smote he Dioxippus, and laid low</p>
<p n="tr">Itys and Promolus and Sagaris</p>
<p n="tr">and Clonius, and from the lofty tower</p>
<p n="tr">shot Idas down. The shaft of Capys pierced</p>
<p n="tr">Privernus, whom Themilla's javelin</p>
<p n="tr">but now had lightly grazed, and he, too bold,</p>
<p n="tr">casting his shield far from him, had outspread</p>
<p n="tr">his left hand on the wound: then sudden flew</p>
<p n="tr">the feathered arrow, and the hand lay pinned</p>
<p n="tr">against his left side, while the fatal barb</p>
<p n="tr">was buried in his breathing life. The son</p>
<p n="tr">of Arcens now stood forth in glittering arms.</p>
<p n="tr">His broidered cloak was red Iberian stain,</p>
<p n="tr">and beautiful was he. Arcens his sire</p>
<p n="tr">had sent him to the war; but he was bred</p>
<p n="tr">in a Sicilian forest by a stream</p>
<p n="tr">to his nymph-mother dear, where rose the shrine</p>
<p n="tr">of merciful Palicus, blest and fair.</p>
<p n="tr">But, lo! Mezentius his spear laid by,</p>
<p n="tr">and whirled three times about his head the thong</p>
<p n="tr">of his loud sling: the leaden bullet clove</p>
<p n="tr">the youth's mid-forehead, and his towering form</p>
<p n="tr">fell prostrate its full length along the ground.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="card"/>'T was then Ascanius first shot forth in war</p>
<p n="tr">the arrow swift from which all creatures wild</p>
<p n="tr">were wont to fly in fear: and he struck down</p>
<p n="tr">with artful aim Numanus, sturdy foe,</p>
<p n="tr">called Remulus, who lately was espoused</p>
<p n="tr">to Turnus' younger sister. He had stalked</p>
<p n="tr">before the van, and made vociferous noise</p>
<p n="tr">of truths and falsehoods foul and base, his heart</p>
<p n="tr">puffed up with new-found greatness. Up and down</p>
<p n="tr">he strode, and swelled his folly with loud words:</p>

<p n="tr">cooped close within a rampart's craven siege,</p>
<p n="tr">O Phrygians twice-vanquished? Is a wall</p>

<p n="tr">are we; our softest new-born babes we dip</p>
<p n="tr">in chilling rivers, till they bear right well</p>
<p n="tr">the current's bitter cold. Our slender lads</p>
<p n="tr">hunt night and day and rove the woods at large,</p>
<p n="tr">or for their merriment break stubborn steeds,</p>
<p n="tr">or bend the horn-tipped bow. Our manly prime</p>

<p n="tr">to poverty and scantness; we subdue</p>
<p n="tr">our lands with rake and mattock, or in war</p>

<p n="tr">Nor doth old age, arriving late, impair</p>
<p n="tr">our brawny vigor, nor corrupt the soul</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="621" unit="card"/>Of such loud insolence and words of shame</p>
<p n="tr">Ascanius brooked no more, but laid a shaft</p>
<p n="tr">athwart his bowstring, and with arms stretched wide</p>
<p n="tr">took aim, first offering suppliant vow to Jove:</p>
<p n="tr">Almighty Jupiter, thy favor show</p>
<p n="tr">to my bold deed! So to thy shrine I bear</p>
<p n="tr">gifts year by year, and to thine altars lead</p>
<p n="tr">a bull with gilded brows, snow-white, and tall</p>
<p n="tr">as his own dam, what time his youth begins</p>
<p n="tr">to lower his horns and fling the sand in air.</p>
<p n="tr">The Father heard, and from a cloudless sky</p>
<p n="tr">thundered to leftward, while the deadly bow</p>
<p n="tr">resounded and the arrow's fearful song</p>
<p n="tr">hissed from the string; it struck unswervingly</p>
<p n="tr">the head of Remulus and clove its way</p>
<p n="tr">deep in the hollows of his brow. Begone!</p>
<p n="tr">Proud mocker at the brave! Lo, this reply</p>
<p n="tr">twice-vanquished Phrygians to Rutulia send.</p>
<p n="tr">Ascanius said no more. The Teucrians </p>
<p n="tr">with deep-voiced shout of joy applaud, and lift</p>
<p n="tr">their exultation starward. <milestone ed="p" n="638" unit="card"/>Then from heaven</p>
<p n="tr">the flowing-haired Apollo bent his gaze</p>
<p n="tr">upon Ausonia's host, and cloud-enthroned</p>
<p n="tr">looked downward o'er the city, speaking thus</p>
<p n="tr">to fair Iulus in his victory:</p>
<p n="tr">Hail to thy maiden prowess, boy! This way</p>
<p n="tr">the starward path to dwelling-place divine.</p>
<p n="tr">O sired of gods and sire of gods to come,</p>
<p n="tr">all future storms of war by Fate ordained</p>
<p n="tr">shall into peace and lawful calm subside</p>
<p n="tr">beneath the offspring of Assaracus.</p>
<p n="tr">No Trojan destinies thy glory bound.</p>
<p n="tr">So saying, from his far, ethereal seat</p>
<p n="tr">he hied him down, and, cleaving the quick winds</p>
<p n="tr">drew near Ascanius. He wore the guise</p>
<p n="tr">of aged Butes, who erewhile had borne</p>
<p n="tr">Anchises, armor and kept trusty guard</p>
<p n="tr">before his threshold, but attended now</p>
<p n="tr">Ascanius, by commandment of his sire.</p>
<p n="tr">Clad in this graybeard's every aspect, moved</p>
<p n="tr">apollo forth,his very voice and hue,</p>
<p n="tr">his hoary locks and grimly sounding shield, </p>
<p n="tr">and to the flushed Iulus spoke this word:</p>

<p n="tr">Numanus unavenged thine arrows feels.</p>
<p n="tr">Such dawn of glory great Apollo's will</p>
<p n="tr">concedes, nor envies thee the fatal shaft</p>
<p n="tr">so like his own. But, tender youth, refrain</p>
<p n="tr">hereafter from this war! So said divine</p>
<p n="tr">Apollo, who, while yet he spoke, put by</p>
<p n="tr">his mortal aspect, and before their eyes</p>
<p n="tr">melted to viewless air. The Teucrians knew</p>
<p n="tr">the vocal god with armament divine</p>
<p n="tr">of arrows; for his rattling quiver smote</p>
<p n="tr">their senses as he fled. Obedient</p>
<p n="tr">to Phoebus' voice they held back from the fray</p>
<p n="tr">Iulus' fury, and their eager souls</p>

<p n="tr">whereat the Teucrians, shouting loud, swept on</p>

<p n="tr">valor and rage constrain him ne'er to cease</p>
<p n="tr">fronting the foe; yet not for all his ire</p>
<p n="tr">can he against such serried steel make way:</p>
<p n="tr">so Turnus backward with a lingering step</p>
<p n="tr">unwilling drew, and wrath his heart oterflowed.</p>
<p n="tr">for twice already had he cloven a path</p>
<p n="tr">into the foe's mid-press, and twice had driven</p>
<p n="tr">their flying lines in panic through the town.</p>
<p n="tr">But now the whole throng from the camp he sees</p>
<p n="tr">massed to the onset. Nor will Juno now</p>
<p n="tr">dare give him vigor to withstand, for Jove</p>
<p n="tr">had sent aerial Iris out of heaven</p>
<p n="tr">with stern commandment to his sister-queen</p>
<p n="tr">that Turnus from the Teucrian walls retire.</p>
<p n="tr">Therefore the warrior's shield avails no more,</p>
<p n="tr">nor his strong arm; but he is overthrown</p>
<p n="tr">by general assault. Around his brows</p>
<p n="tr">his smitten helmet rings; the ponderous mail</p>
<p n="tr">cracks under falling stones; the haughty plumes</p>
<p n="tr">are scattered from his head, nor can the boss</p>

<p n="tr">forged for a gift and rimmed about with gold.</p>
<p n="tr">To-morrow's lightdeem not my words be vain!</p>
<p n="tr">shall shine on huge heaps of Rutulia's dead.</p>
<p n="tr">So saying, she pushed with her right hand the stern</p>
<p n="tr">with skilful thrust, and vanished. The ship sped</p>
<p n="tr">swift as a spear, or as an arrow flies</p>
<p n="tr">no whit behind the wind: and all the fleet</p>
<p n="tr">quickened its course. Anchises' princely son,</p>
<p n="tr">dumb and bewildered stood, but took good heart</p>
<p n="tr">at such an omen fair. Then in few words</p>
<p n="tr">with eyes upturned to heaven he made his prayer:</p>
<p n="tr">Mother of gods, O Ida's Queen benign,</p>
<p n="tr">who Iovest Dindymus and towns with towers,</p>
<p n="tr">and lion-yokes obedient to thy rein,</p>
<p n="tr">be thou my guide in battle, and fulfil</p>
<p n="tr">thine augury divine. In <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>'s cause</p>
<p n="tr">be present evermore with favoring power!</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke no more. For now the wheels of day</p>
<p n="tr">had sped full circle into perfect light,</p>
<p n="tr">the dark expelling. Then, for his first care,</p>
<p n="tr">he bade his captains heed the signal given,</p>
<p n="tr">equip their souls for war, and wait in arms</p>
<p n="tr">the coming fray. <milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="card"/>Now holds he full in view</p>
<p n="tr">his Trojans and their fortress, as he stands</p>
<p n="tr">upon his towering ship. With his left hand</p>
<p n="tr">he lifts his radiant shield; then from the wall</p>
<p n="tr">the Dardan warriors send a battle-cry</p>
<p n="tr">that echoes to the stars, as kindling hope</p>
<p n="tr">their rage renews. A flight of spears they hurl:</p>
<p n="tr">'t was like the cranes of Strymon, through dark clouds</p>
<p n="tr">each other calling, when they cleave the skies</p>
<p n="tr">vociferous, outwinging as they fly</p>
<p n="tr">the swift south windsIoud music them pursues.</p>
<p n="tr">Amazement on Ausonia's captains fell</p>
<p n="tr">and Turnus, as they gazed. But soon they saw</p>
<p n="tr">ships pointing shoreward and the watery plain</p>
<p n="tr">all stirring with a fleet. Aeneas' helm</p>
<p n="tr">uplifted its bright peak,like streaming flame</p>
<p n="tr">the crimson crest; his shield of orbed gold</p>
<p n="tr">poured forth prodigious fire: it seemed as when</p>
<p n="tr">in cloudless night a comet's blood-red beam</p>
<p n="tr">makes mournful splendor, or the Dog-star glows,</p>
<p n="tr">which rises to bring drought and pestilence</p>
<p n="tr">to hapless men, and with ill-omened ray</p>
<p n="tr">saddens the sky. <milestone ed="p" n="276" unit="card"/>But Turnus, undismayed,</p>
<p n="tr">trusted not less to hurl th' invaders back</p>
<p n="tr">and hold the shore against them. Look! he cried,</p>
<p n="tr">your prayer is come to pass,that sword in hand</p>
<p n="tr">ye now may shatter them. The might of Mars</p>
<p n="tr">is in a true man's blow. Remember well</p>
<p n="tr">each man his home and wife! Now call to mind</p>
<p n="tr">the glory and great deeds of all your sires!</p>
<p n="tr">Charge to yon river-bank, while yet they take</p>
<p n="tr">with weak and fearful steps their shoreward way!</p>
<p n="tr">Fortune will help the brave. With words like these,</p>
<p n="tr">he chose, well-weighing, who should lead the charge,</p>
<p n="tr">who at the leaguered walls the fight sustain.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="287" unit="card"/>Aeneas straightway from his lofty ships</p>
<p n="tr">lets down his troop by bridges. Some await</p>
<p n="tr">the ebbing of slack seas, and boldly leap</p>
<p n="tr">into the shallows; others ply the oar.</p>
<p n="tr">Tarchon a beach discovers, where the sands</p>
<p n="tr">sing not, nor waves with broken murmur fall,</p>
<p n="tr">but full and silent swells the gentle sea.</p>
<p n="tr">Steering in haste that way, he called his crews:</p>
<p n="tr">Now bend to your stout oars, my chosen brave.</p>
<p n="tr">Lift each ship forward, till her beak shall cleave</p>
<p n="tr">yon hostile shore; and let her keel's full weight</p>
<p n="tr">the furrow drive. I care not if we break</p>
<p n="tr">our ship's side in so sure an anchorage,</p>
<p n="tr">if once we land. While Tarchon urged them thus,</p>
<p n="tr">the crews bent all together to their blades</p>
<p n="tr">and sped their foaming barks to <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>'s plain,</p>
<p n="tr">till each beak gripped the sand and every keel</p>
<p n="tr">lay on dry land unscathed:all save thine own,</p>
<p n="tr">O Tarchon! dashed upon a sand-bar, she!</p>
<p n="tr">Long poised upon the cruel ridge she hung,</p>
<p n="tr">tilted this way or that and beat the waves,</p>
<p n="tr">then split, and emptied forth upon the tide</p>
<p n="tr">her warriors; and now the drifting wreck</p>
<p n="tr">of shattered oars and thwarts entangles them,</p>
<p n="tr">or ebb of swirling waters sucks them down.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="308" unit="card"/>Turnus no lingering knows, but fiercely hurls</p>
<p n="tr">his whole line on the Teucrians, and makes stand</p>
<p n="tr">along the shore. Now peals the trumpet's call.</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas in the van led on his troop</p>
<p n="tr">against the rustic foe, bright augury</p>
<p n="tr">for opening war, and laid the Latins low,</p>
<p n="tr">slaughtering Theron, a huge chief who dared</p>
<p n="tr">offer Aeneas battle; through the scales</p>
<p n="tr">of brazen mail and corselet stiff with gold</p>
<p n="tr">the sword drove deep, and gored the gaping side.</p>
<p n="tr">Then smote he Lichas, from his mother's womb</p>
<p n="tr">ripped in her dying hour, and unto thee,</p>
<p n="tr">O Phoebus, vowed, because his infant days</p>
<p n="tr">escaped the fatal steel. Hard by him fell</p>
<p n="tr">stout Cisseus and gigantic Gyas; these</p>
<p n="tr">to death were hurled, while with their knotted clubs</p>
<p n="tr">they slew opposing hosts; but naught availed</p>
<p n="tr">Herculean weapons, nor their mighty hands,</p>
<p n="tr">or that Melampus was their sire, a peer</p>
<p n="tr">of Hercules, what time in heavy toils</p>
<p n="tr">through earth he roved. See next how Pharon boasts!</p>
<p n="tr">But while he vainly raves, the whirling spear</p>
<p n="tr">smites full on his loud mouth. And also thou,</p>
<p n="tr">Cydon, wast by the Trojan stroke o'erthrown,</p>
<p n="tr">while following in ill-omened haste the steps</p>
<p n="tr">of Clytius, thy last joy, whose round cheek wore</p>
<p n="tr">its youthful golden down: soon hadst thou lain</p>
<p n="tr">in death, unheeding of thy fancies fond</p>
<p n="tr">which ever turned to youth;but now arose</p>
<p n="tr">the troop of all thy brothers, Phorcus' sons,</p>
<p n="tr">a close array of seven, and seven spears</p>
<p n="tr">they hurled: some from Aeneas' helm or shield</p>
<p n="tr">glanced off in vain; some Venus' kindly power,</p>
<p n="tr">just as they touched his body, turned away.</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas then to true Achates cried:</p>
<p n="tr">Bring on my spears: not one shall fruitless fly</p>
<p n="tr">against yon Rutules, even as they pierced</p>
<p n="tr">the breasts of Greeks upon the Ilian plain.</p>
<p n="tr">Then one great shaft he seized and threw; it sped</p>
<p n="tr">straight into Maeon's brazen shield, and clove</p>
<p n="tr">his mail-clad heart. Impetuous to his aid</p>
<p n="tr">brother Alcanor came, and lifted up</p>
<p n="tr">with strong right hand his brother as he fell:</p>
<p n="tr">but through his arm a second skilful shaft</p>
<p n="tr">made bloody way, and by the sinews held</p>
<p n="tr">the lifeless right hand from the shoulder swung.</p>
<p n="tr">Then from his brother's body Numitor</p>
<p n="tr">the weapon plucked and hurled it, furious,</p>
<p n="tr">upon Aeneas; but it could not strike</p>
<p n="tr">the hero's self, and grazed along the thigh</p>
<p n="tr">of great Achates. <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="card"/>Next into the fight</p>
<p n="tr">Clausus of Cures came, in youthful bloom</p>
<p n="tr">exulting, and with far-thrown javelin</p>
<p n="tr">struck Dryops at the chin, and took away</p>
<p n="tr">from the gashed, shrieking throat both life and voice;</p>
<p n="tr">the warrior's fallen forehead smote the dust;</p>
<p n="tr">his lips poured forth thick blood. There also fell</p>
<p n="tr">three Thracians, odspring of the lordly stem</p>

<p n="tr">is one wide strife. As when o'er leagues of air</p>

<p n="tr">had scattered rolling boulders and torn trees</p>
<p n="tr">uprooted from the shore, young Pallas spied</p>
<p n="tr">th' Arcadian band, unused to fight on foot,</p>
<p n="tr">in full retreat, the Latins following close</p>
<p n="tr">who also for the roughness of the ground</p>
<p n="tr">were all unmounted: he (the last resource</p>
<p n="tr">of men in straits) to wild entreaty turned</p>
<p n="tr">and taunts, enkindling their faint hearts anew:</p>
<p n="tr">Whither, my men! O, by your own brave deeds,</p>
<p n="tr">O, by our lord Evander's happy wars,</p>
<p n="tr">the proud hopes I had to make my name</p>
<p n="tr">a rival glory,think not ye can fly!</p>
<p n="tr">Your swords alone can carve ye the safe way</p>
<p n="tr">straight through your foes. Where yonder warrior-throng</p>
<p n="tr">is fiercest, thickest, there and only there</p>
<p n="tr">your Country's honor calls for men like you,</p>
<p n="tr">and for your captain Pallas. Nay, no gods</p>
<p n="tr">against us fight; we are but mortal men</p>
<p n="tr">pressed by a mortal foe. Not more than ours</p>
<p n="tr">the number of their lives or swords. Behold,</p>
<p n="tr">the barrier of yonder spreading sea</p>
<p n="tr">emprisons us, and for a craven flight</p>
<p n="tr">yon lands are all too small. Ha! Shall we steer</p>
<p n="tr">across the sea to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>? He said, and sprang</p>
<p n="tr">full in the centre of his gathered foes.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="card"/>First in his path was Lagus, thither led</p>
<p n="tr">by evil stars; whom, as he tried to lift</p>
<p n="tr">a heavy stone, the shaft of Pallas pierced</p>
<p n="tr">where ribs and spine divide: backward he drew</p>
<p n="tr">the clinging spear; But Hisbo from above</p>
<p n="tr">surprised him not, though meaning it; for while</p>
<p n="tr">(In anger blind for friend unpitying slain)</p>
<p n="tr">at Pallas' face he flew:he, standing firm,</p>
<p n="tr">plunged deep into that swelling breast the sword.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Sthenius he slew; and next Anchemolus</p>
<p n="tr">of Rhoetus' ancient line, who dared defile</p>
<p n="tr">his step-dame's bridal bed. And also ye,</p>
<p n="tr">fair Thymber and Larides, Daucus' twins,</p>
<p n="tr">fell on that Rutule field; so like were ye,</p>
<p n="tr">your own kin scarce discerned, and parents proud</p>
<p n="tr">smiled at the dear deceit; but now in death</p>
<p n="tr">cruel unlikeness Pallas wrought; thy head</p>
<p n="tr">fell, hapless Thymber, by Evander's sword;</p>
<p n="tr">and thy right hand, Larides, shorn away,</p>
<p n="tr">seemed feeling for its Iord; the fingers cold</p>
<p n="tr">clutched, trembling, at the sword. Now all the troop</p>
<p n="tr">of Arcady, their chief's great action seen,</p>
<p n="tr">and by his warning roused, made at their foes,</p>
<p n="tr">spurred on by grief and shame. <milestone ed="p" n="399" unit="card"/>Next Pallas pierced</p>
<p n="tr">the flying Rhoetus in his car; this gained</p>
<p n="tr">for Ilus respite and delay, for him</p>
<p n="tr">the stout spear aimed at; but its flight was stopped</p>
<p n="tr">by Rhoetus, as in swift retreat he rode,</p>
<p n="tr">by the two high-born brothers close pursued,</p>
<p n="tr">Teuthras and Tyres: from his car he rolled,</p>
<p n="tr">making deep furrows with his lifeless heels</p>

<p n="tr">of summer, long awaited, rise and blow,</p>
<p n="tr">a shepherd fires the forest, and the blaze</p>
<p n="tr">devours the dense grove, while o'er the fields,</p>
<p n="tr">in that one moment, swift and sudden spread</p>
<p n="tr">grim Vulcan's serried flames; from some high seat</p>
<p n="tr">on distant hill, the shepherd peering down</p>
<p n="tr">sees, glad at heart, his own victorious fires:</p>
<p n="tr">so now fierce valor spreads, uniting all</p>
<p n="tr">in one confederate rage, 'neath Pallas' eyes.</p>
<p n="tr">But the fierce warrior Halaesus next</p>
<p n="tr">led on the charge, behind his skilful shield</p>
<p n="tr">close-crouching. Ladon and Demodocus</p>
<p n="tr">and Pheres he struck down; his glittering blade</p>
<p n="tr">cut Strymon's hand, which to his neck was raised,</p>
<p n="tr">sheer off; with one great stone he crushed the brows</p>
<p n="tr">of Thoas, scattering wide the broken skull,</p>
<p n="tr">bones, brains, and gore. Halaesus' prophet-sire,</p>
<p n="tr">foreseeing doom, had hid him in dark groves;</p>
<p n="tr">but when the old man's fading eyes declined</p>
<p n="tr">in death, the hand of Fate reached forth and doomed</p>

<p n="tr">through stout Halaesus' heart its lucky way!</p>
<p n="tr">The spoil and trophy of the hero slain</p>
<p n="tr">on thine own oak shall hang. The god received</p>
<p n="tr">the vow, and while Halaesus held his shield</p>
<p n="tr">over Imaon, his ill-fated breast</p>
<p n="tr">lay naked to th' Arcadian's hungry spear.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="426" unit="card"/>But Lausus, seeing such a hero slain,</p>
<p n="tr">bade his troop have no fear, for he himself</p>
<p n="tr">was no small strength in war; and first he slew</p>
<p n="tr">Abas, who fought hard, and had ever seemed</p>
<p n="tr">himself the sticking-point and tug of war.</p>
  <p n="tr">Down went <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>'s warriors, and slain</p>

<p n="tr">the Greek had spared. Troop charges upon troop</p>
<p n="tr">well-matched in might, with chiefs of like renown;</p>
<p n="tr">the last rank crowds the first;so fierce the press</p>
<p n="tr">scarce hand or sword can stir. Here Pallas stands,</p>
<p n="tr">and pushes back the foe; before him looms</p>
<p n="tr">Lausus, his youthful peer, conspicuous both</p>
<p n="tr">in beauty; but no star will them restore</p>
<p n="tr">to home and native land. Yet would the King</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="439" unit="card"/>Now Turnus' goddess-sister bids him haste</p>
<p n="tr">to Lausus' help. So he, in wheeling car,</p>
<p n="tr">cut through the lines; and when his friends he saw,</p>
<p n="tr">Let the fight stop!  he cried, for none but I</p>
<p n="tr">may strike at Pallas; unto me alone</p>
<p n="tr">the prize of Pallas falls. I would his sire</p>
<p n="tr">stood by to see. He spake: his troop withdrew</p>
<p n="tr">a fitting space. But as they made him room,</p>
<p n="tr">the young prince, wondering at the scornful words,</p>
<p n="tr">looked upon Turnus, glancing up and down</p>
<p n="tr">that giant frame, and with fierce-frowning brows</p>
<p n="tr">scanned him from far, hurling defiant words</p>
<p n="tr">in answer to the King's. My honor now</p>
<p n="tr">shall have the royal trophy of this war,</p>
<p n="tr">or glorious death. For either fortune fair</p>
<p n="tr">my sire is ready. Threaten me no more!</p>
<p n="tr">So saying, to the midmost space he strode,</p>
<p n="tr">and in Arcadian hearts the blood stood still.</p>
<p n="tr">Swift from his chariot Turnus leaped, and ran</p>
<p n="tr">to closer fight. As when some lion sees</p>
<p n="tr">from his far mountain-lair a raging bull</p>
<p n="tr">that sniffs the battle from the grassy field,</p>
<p n="tr">and down the steep he fliessuch picture showed</p>
<p n="tr">grim Turnus as he came. But when he seemed</p>
<p n="tr">within a spear's cast, Pallas opened fight,</p>
<p n="tr">expecting Fortune's favor to the brave</p>
<p n="tr">in such unequal match; and thus he prayed:</p>
<p n="tr">O, by my hospitable father's roof,</p>
<p n="tr">where thou didst enter as a stranger-guest,</p>
<p n="tr">hear me, Alcides, and give aid divine</p>
<p n="tr">to this great deed. Let Turnus see these hands</p>
<p n="tr">strip from his half-dead breast the bloody spoil!</p>
<p n="tr">and let his eyes in death endure to see</p>
<p n="tr">his conqueror! Alcides heard the youth:</p>
<p n="tr">but prisoned in his heart a deep-drawn sigh,</p>
<p n="tr">and shed vain tears; for Jove, the King and Sire, .</p>
<p n="tr">spoke with benignant accents to his son:</p>
<p n="tr">To each his day is given. Beyond recall</p>
<p n="tr">man's little time runs by: but to prolong</p>
<p n="tr">life's glory by great deeds is virtue's power.</p>
<p n="tr">Beneath the lofty walls of fallen <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></p>
<p n="tr">fell many a son of Heaven. Yea, there was slain</p>
<p n="tr">Sarpedon, my own offspring. Turnus too</p>
<p n="tr">is summoned to his doom, and nears the bounds</p>
<p n="tr">of his appointed span. So speaking, Jove</p>
<p n="tr">turned from Rutulia's war his eyes away.</p>
<p n="tr">But Pallas hurled his lance with might and main,</p>
<p n="tr">and from its hollow scabbard flashed his sword.</p>
<p n="tr">The flying shaft touched where the plated steel</p>
<p n="tr">over the shoulders rose, and worked its way</p>
<p n="tr">through the shield's rimthen falling, glanced aside</p>
<p n="tr">from Turnus' giant body. <milestone ed="p" n="479" unit="card"/>Turnus then</p>
<p n="tr">poised, without haste, his iron-pointed spear,</p>
<p n="tr">and, launching it on Pallas, cried, Look now</p>
<p n="tr">will not this shaft a good bit deeper drive?</p>
<p n="tr">He said: and through the mid-boss of the shield,</p>
<p n="tr">steel scales and brass with bull's-hide folded round,</p>
<p n="tr">the quivering spear-point crashed resistlessly,</p>
<p n="tr">and through the corselet's broken barrier</p>
<p n="tr">pierced Pallas' heart. The youth plucked out in vain</p>
<p n="tr">the hot shaft from the wound; his life and blood</p>
<p n="tr">together ebbed away, as sinking prone</p>
<p n="tr">on his rent side he fell; above him rang</p>
<p n="tr">his armor; and from lips with blood defiled</p>
<p n="tr">he breathed his last upon his foeman's ground.</p>
<p n="tr">Over him Turnus stood: Arcadians all,</p>
<p n="tr">He cried, take tidings of this feat of arms</p>
<p n="tr">to King Evander. With a warrior's wage</p>
<p n="tr">his Pallas I restore, and freely grant</p>
<p n="tr">what glory in a hero's tomb may lie,</p>
<p n="tr">or comfort in a grave. They dearly pay</p>
<p n="tr">who bid Aeneas welcome at their board.</p>
<p n="tr">So saying, with his left foot he held down</p>
<p n="tr">the lifeless form, and raised the heavy weight</p>
<p n="tr">of graven belt, which pictured forth that crime</p>
<p n="tr">of youthful company by treason slain,</p>
<p n="tr">all on their wedding night, in bridal bowers</p>
<p n="tr">to horrid murder given,which Clonus, son</p>
<p n="tr">of Eurytus, had wrought in lavish gold;</p>
<p n="tr">this Turnus in his triumph bore away,</p>
<p n="tr">exulting in the spoil. O heart of man,</p>
<p n="tr">not knowing doom, nor of events to be!</p>
<p n="tr">Nor, being lifted up, to keep thy bounds</p>
<p n="tr">in prosperous days! To Turnus comes the hour</p>
<p n="tr">when he would fain a prince's ransom give</p>
<p n="tr">had Pallas passed unscathed, and will bewail</p>
<p n="tr">cuch spoil of victory. With weeping now</p>
<p n="tr">and lamentations Ioud his comrades lay</p>
<p n="tr">young Pallas on his shield, and thronging close</p>
<p n="tr">carry him homeward with a mournful song:</p>
<p n="tr">alas! the sorrow and the glorious gain</p>
<p n="tr">thy sire shall have in thee. For one brief day</p>
<p n="tr">bore thee to battle and now bears away;</p>
<p n="tr">yet leavest thou full tale of foemen slain.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="card"/>No doubtful rumor to Aeneas breaks</p>
<p n="tr">the direful news, but a sure messenger</p>
<p n="tr">tells him his followers' peril, and implores</p>
<p n="tr">prompt help for routed <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. His ready sword</p>
<p n="tr">reaped down the nearest foes, and through their line</p>
<p n="tr">clove furious path and broad; the valiant blade</p>
<p n="tr">through oft-repeated bloodshed groped its way,</p>
<p n="tr">proud Turnus, unto thee! His heart beholds</p>
<p n="tr">Pallas and Sire Evander, their kind board</p>
<p n="tr">in welcome spread, their friendly league of peace</p>
<p n="tr">proffered and sealed with him, the stranger-guest.</p>
<p n="tr">So Sulmo's sons, four warriors, and four</p>

<p n="tr">as victims to the shades, and pour a stream</p>

<p n="tr">Next from afar his hostile shaft he threw</p>
<p n="tr">at Mago, who with wary motion bowed</p>
<p n="tr">beneath the quivering weapon, as it sped</p>

<p n="tr">he crouched and clung with supplicating cry:</p>
<p n="tr">O, by thy father's spirit, by thy hope</p>
<p n="tr">in young Iulus, I implore thee, spare</p>
<p n="tr">for son and father's sake this life of mine.</p>
<p n="tr">A lofty house have I, where safely hid</p>

<p n="tr">of wrought and unwrought gold. The fate of war</p>
<p n="tr">hangs not on me; nor can one little life</p>
<p n="tr">thy victory decide. In answer spoke</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas: Hoard the silver and the gold</p>
<p n="tr">for thy own sons. Such bartering in war</p>

<p n="tr">Thus bids Anchises' shade, Iulusthus!</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke: and, grasping with his mighty left</p>
<p n="tr">the helmet of the vainly suppliant foe,</p>
<p n="tr">bent back the throat and drove hilt-deep his sword.</p>
<p n="tr">A little space removed, Haemonides,</p>

<p n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,7006704">Anxur</placeName>'s left hand, and the whole orbed shield</p>

<p n="tr">the brothers Lucagus and Liger drove</p>
<p n="tr">into the heart of battle: Liger kept</p>
<p n="tr">with skilful hand the manage of the steeds;</p>
<p n="tr">bold Lucagus swung wide his naked sword.</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas, by their wrathful brows defied,</p>
<p n="tr">brooked not the sight, but to the onset flew,</p>

<p n="tr">The last of life and strife shall be thy meed</p>
<p n="tr">upon this very ground. Such raving word</p>
<p n="tr">flowed loud from Liger's lip: not with a word</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan hero answered him, but flung</p>
<p n="tr">his whirling spear; and even as Lucagus</p>

<p n="tr">O Lucagus, thy chariot did not yield</p>
<p n="tr">because of horses slow to fly, or scared</p>
<p n="tr">by shadows of a foe. It was thyself</p>
<p n="tr">leaped o'er the wheel and fled. So saying, he grasped</p>
<p n="tr">the horses by the rein. The brother then,</p>
<p n="tr">spilled also from the car, reached wildly forth</p>

<p n="tr">hides in the bosom, he thrust deep his sword.</p>
<p n="tr">Thus o'er the field of war the Dardan King</p>
<p n="tr">moved on, death-dealing: like a breaking flood</p>
<p n="tr">or cloudy whirlwind seemed his wrath. Straightway</p>

<p n="tr">Why vex one sick at heart, who humbly fears</p>

<p n="tr">what once I had, my proper right and due,</p>

<p n="tr">Juno made answer: Can it be thy mind</p>

<p n="tr">This sword will give thee title to some land</p>
<p n="tr">thou hast sailed far to find! So clamoring loud</p>

<p n="tr">the vessel's prow, when Juno cut her loose,</p>

<p n="tr">Aeneas to the battle vainly called</p>

<p n="tr">stretched many a hero dead. No longer now</p>
<p n="tr">the mocking shadow sought to hide, but soared</p>
<p n="tr">visibly upward and was Iost in cloud,</p>

<p n="tr">in prayer to Heaven: O Sire omnipotent!</p>
<p n="tr">Didst thou condemn me to a shame like this?</p>

<p n="tr">Whence came I here? What panic wafts away</p>

<p n="tr">each, when the sun returns, his task pursues:</p>
<p n="tr">so great Aeneas, by assault o'erwhelmed,</p>
<p n="tr">endured the cloud of battle, till its rage</p>
<p n="tr">thundered no more; then with a warning word</p>
<p n="tr">to Lausus with upbraiding voice he called:</p>
<p n="tr">Why, O death-doomed, rush on to deeds too high</p>
<p n="tr">for strength like thine. Thou art betrayed, rash boy,</p>
<p n="tr">by thine own loyal heart! But none the less</p>
<p n="tr">the youth made mad defence; while fiercer burned</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan's anger; and of Lausus' days</p>
<p n="tr">the loom of Fate spun forth the last thin thread;</p>
<p n="tr">for now Aeneas thrust his potent blade</p>
<p n="tr">deep through the stripling's breast and out of sight;</p>
<p n="tr">through the light shield it passeda frail defence</p>
<p n="tr">to threaten with!and through the tunic fine</p>
<p n="tr">his mother's hand had wrought with softest gold:</p>
<p n="tr">blood filled his bosom, and on path of air</p>
<p n="tr">down to the shades the mournful soul withdrew,</p>
<p n="tr">its body quitting. As Anchises' son</p>
<p n="tr">beheld the agonizing lips and brow</p>
<p n="tr">so wondrous white in death, he groaned aloud</p>
<p n="tr">in pity, and reached o'er him his right hand,</p>
<p n="tr">touched to the heart such likeness to behold</p>
<p n="tr">of his own filial love. Unhappy boy!</p>
<p n="tr">What reward worthy of heroic deeds</p>
<p n="tr">can I award thee now? Wear still those arms</p>
<p n="tr">so proudly worn! And I will send thee home</p>
<p n="tr">(Perhaps thou carest!) to the kindred shades</p>
<p n="tr">and ashes of thy sires. But let it be</p>
<p n="tr">some solace in thy pitiable doom</p>
<p n="tr">that none but great Aeneas wrought thy fall.</p>
<p n="tr">Then to the stripling's tardy followers</p>
<p n="tr">he sternly called, and lifted from the earth</p>
<p n="tr">with his own hand the fallen foe: dark blood</p>
<p n="tr">defiled those princely tresses braided fair.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="833" unit="card"/>Meanwhile Mezentius by the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>'s wave</p>
<p n="tr">with water staunched his wound, and propped his weight</p>
<p n="tr">against a tree; upon its limbs above</p>
<p n="tr">his brazen helmet hung, and on the sward</p>
<p n="tr">his ponderous arms lay resting. Round him watched</p>
<p n="tr">his chosen braves. He, gasping and in pain,</p>
<p n="tr">clutched at his neck and let his flowing beard</p>
<p n="tr">loose on his bosom fall; he questions oft</p>
<p n="tr">of Lausus, and sends many a messenger</p>
<p n="tr">to bid him back, and bear him the command</p>
<p n="tr">of his sore-grieving sire. But lo! his peers</p>
<p n="tr">bore the dead Lausus back upon his shield,</p>
<p n="tr">and wept to see so strong a hero quelled</p>
<p n="tr">by stroke so strong. From long way off the sire,</p>
<p n="tr">with soul prophetic of its woe, perceived</p>
<p n="tr">what meant their wail and cry. On his gray hairs</p>
<p n="tr">the dust he flung, and, stretching both his hands</p>
<p n="tr">to heaven, he cast himself the corpse along.</p>
<p n="tr">O son, he cried, was life to me so sweet,</p>
<p n="tr">that I to save myself surrendered o'er</p>
<p n="tr">my own begotten to a foeman's steel?</p>
<p n="tr">Saved by these gashes shall thy father be,</p>
<p n="tr">and living by thy death? O wretched me,</p>
<p n="tr">how foul an end have I! Now is my wound</p>
<p n="tr">deep! deep! 't was I, dear son, have stained</p>
<p n="tr">thy name with infamyto exile driven</p>
<p n="tr">from sceptre and hereditary throne</p>
<p n="tr">by general curse. Would that myself had borne</p>
<p n="tr">my country's vengeance and my nation's hate!</p>
<p n="tr">Would my own guilty life my debt had paid</p>
<p n="tr">yea, by a thousand deaths! But, see, I live!</p>
<p n="tr">Not yet from human kind and light of day</p>
<p n="tr">have I departed. But depart I will.</p>
<p n="tr">So saying, he raised him on his crippled thigh,</p>
<p n="tr">and though by reason of the grievous wound</p>
<p n="tr">his forces ebbed, yet with unshaken mien</p>
<p n="tr">he bade them lead his war-horse forth, his pride,</p>
<p n="tr">his solace, which from every war</p>
<p n="tr">victorious bore him home. The master then</p>
<p n="tr">to the brave beast, which seemed to know his pain,</p>
<p n="tr">spoke thus: My Rhoebus, we have passed our days</p>
<p n="tr">long time together, if long time there be</p>
<p n="tr">for mortal creatures. Either on this day</p>
<p n="tr">thou shalt his bloody spoils in triumph bear</p>
<p n="tr">and that Aeneas' head,and so shalt be</p>
<p n="tr">avenger of my Lausus' woe; or else,</p>
<p n="tr">if I be vanquished, thou shalt sink and fall</p>
<p n="tr">beside me. For, my bravest, thou wouldst spurn</p>
<p n="tr">a stranger's will, and Teucrian lords to bear.</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke and, mounting to his back, disposed</p>
<p n="tr">his limbs the wonted way and filled both hands</p>
<p n="tr">with pointed javelins; a helm of brass</p>
<p n="tr">with shaggy horse-hair crest gleamed o'er his brow.</p>
<p n="tr">Swift to the front he rode: a mingled flood</p>
<p n="tr">surged in his heart of sorrow, wrath, and shame;</p>
<p n="tr">and thrice with loud voice on his foe he called.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="873" unit="card"/>Aeneas heard and made exulting vow:</p>
<p n="tr">Now may the Father of the gods on high,</p>
<p n="tr">and great Apollo hear! Begin the fray!</p>
<p n="tr">He said, and moved forth with a threatening spear.</p>
<p n="tr">The other cried: Hast robbed me of my son,</p>
<p n="tr">and now, implacable, wouldst fright me more?</p>
<p n="tr">That way, that only, was it in thy power</p>
<p n="tr">to cast me down. No fear of death I feel.</p>
<p n="tr">Nor from thy gods themselves would I refrain.</p>
<p n="tr">Give o'er! For fated and resolved to die</p>
<p n="tr">I come thy way: but; bring thee as I pass</p>

<p n="tr">against his foe, and after it drove deep</p>
<p n="tr">another and another, riding swift</p>
<p n="tr">in wide gyration round him. But the shield,</p>
<p n="tr">the golden boss, broke not. Three times he rode</p>
<p n="tr">in leftward circles, hurling spear on spear</p>
<p n="tr">against th' unmoved Aeneas: and three times</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan hero in his brazen shield</p>
<p n="tr">the sheaf of spears upbore. But such slow fight,</p>
<p n="tr">such plucking of spent shafts from out his shield,</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan liked not, vexed and sorely tried</p>
<p n="tr">in duel so ill-matched. With wrathful soul</p>
<p n="tr">at length he strode forth, and between the brows</p>
<p n="tr">of the wild war-horse planted his Iong spear.</p>
<p n="tr">Up reared the creature, beating at the air</p>
<p n="tr">with quivering feet, then o'er his fallen lord</p>
<p n="tr">entangling dropped, and prone above him lay,</p>
<p n="tr">pinning with ponderous shoulder to the ground.</p>
<p n="tr">The Trojans and the Latins rouse the skies</p>
<p n="tr">with clamor Ioud. Aeneas hastening forth</p>
<p n="tr">unsheathes his sword, and looming o'er him cries:</p>
<p n="tr">Where now is fierce Mezentius, and his soul's</p>
<p n="tr">wild pulse of rage? The Tuscan in reply</p>
<p n="tr">with eyes uprolled, and gasping as he gave</p>
<p n="tr">long looks at heaven, recalled his fading mind:</p>
<p n="tr">Why frown at me and fume, O bitterest foe?</p>
<p n="tr">Why threaten death? To slay me is no sin.</p>
<p n="tr">Not to take quarter came I to this war,</p>
<p n="tr">not truce with thee did my lost Lausus crave,</p>
<p n="tr">yet this one boon I pray,if mercy be</p>
<p n="tr">for fallen foes: O, suffer me when dead</p>
<p n="tr">in covering earth to hide! Full well I know</p>
<p n="tr">what curses of my people ring me round.</p>
<p n="tr">Defend me from that rage! I pray to be</p>
<p n="tr">my son's companion in our common tomb.</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke: then offered with unshrinking eye</p>
<p n="tr">his veined throat to the sword. O'er the bright mail</p>
<p n="tr">his vital breath gushed forth in streaming gore.</p></div1>

<p n="tr">Up from the sea now soared the dawning day:</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas, though his sorrow bids him haste</p>
<p n="tr">to burial of the slain, and his sad soul</p>
<p n="tr">is clouded with the sight of death, fulfils,</p>
<p n="tr">for reward to his gods, a conqueror's vow,</p>
<p n="tr">at morning's earliest beam. A mighty oak</p>
<p n="tr">shorn of its limbs he sets upon a hill</p>
<p n="tr">and clothes it o'er with glittering arms, the spoil</p>
<p n="tr">of King Mezentius, and a trophy proud</p>
<p n="tr">to thee, great lord of war. The hero's plumes</p>
<p n="tr">bedewed with blood are there, and splintered spears;</p>
<p n="tr">there hangs the corselet, by the thrusting steel</p>
<p n="tr">twelve times gored through; upon the left he binds</p>
<p n="tr">the brazen shield, and from the neck suspends</p>
<p n="tr">the ivory-hilted sword. Aeneas thus,</p>

<p n="tr">and to the bitterness of death consigned.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="29" unit="card"/>Weeping he spoke, and slowly backward drew</p>
<p n="tr">to the tent-door, where by the breathless clay</p>
<p n="tr">of Pallas stood Acoetes, aged man,</p>
<p n="tr">once bearer of Evander's arms, but now</p>
<p n="tr">under less happy omens set to guard</p>
<p n="tr">his darling child. Around him is a throng</p>
<p n="tr">of slaves, with all the Trojan multitude,</p>
<p n="tr">and Ilian women, who the wonted way</p>
<p n="tr">let sorrow's tresses loosely flow. When now</p>
<p n="tr">Aeneas to the lofty doors drew near,</p>
<p n="tr">all these from smitten bosoms raised to heaven</p>
<p n="tr">a mighty moaning, till the King's abode</p>
<p n="tr">was loud with anguish. There Aeneas viewed</p>
<p n="tr">the pillowed head of Pallas cold and pale,</p>
<p n="tr">the smooth young breast that bore the gaping wound</p>
<p n="tr">of that Ausonian spear, and weeping said:</p>
<p n="tr">Did Fortune's envy, smiling though she came,</p>
<p n="tr">refuse me, hapless boy, that thou shouldst see</p>
<p n="tr">my throne established, and victorious ride</p>
<p n="tr">beside me to thy father's house? Not this</p>

<p n="tr">to win imperial power he bade me go;</p>
<p n="tr">yet warned me anxiously I must resist</p>
<p n="tr">bold warriors and a stubborn breed of foes.</p>
<p n="tr">And haply even now he cheats his heart</p>
<p n="tr">with expectation vain, and offers vows,</p>

<p n="tr">But we with unavailing honors bring</p>
<p n="tr">this lifeless youth, who owes the gods of heaven</p>
<p n="tr">no more of gift and vow. O ill-starred King!</p>
<p n="tr">Soon shalt thou see thy son's unpitying doom!</p>
<p n="tr">What a home-coming! This is glory's day</p>
<p n="tr">so Iong awaited; this the solemn pledge</p>
<p n="tr">I proudly gave. But fond Evander's eyes</p>
<p n="tr">will find no shameful wounding on the slain,</p>
<p n="tr">nor for a son in coward safety kept</p>
<p n="tr">wilt thou, the sire, crave death. But woe is me!</p>

<p n="tr">he bids them lift the body to the bier,</p>
<p n="tr">and sends a thousand heroes from his host</p>
<p n="tr">to render the last tributes, and to share</p>
<p n="tr">father's tears:poor solace and too small</p>
<p n="tr">for grief so great, but due that mournful sire.</p>
<p n="tr">Some busy them to build of osiers fine</p>
<p n="tr">the simple litter, twining sapling oaks</p>
<p n="tr">with evergreen, till o'er death's Iofty bed</p>
<p n="tr">the branching shade extends. Upon it lay,</p>
<p n="tr">as if on shepherd's couch, the youthful dead,</p>
<p n="tr">like fairest flower by virgin fingers culled,</p>
<p n="tr">frail violet or hyacinth forlorn,</p>
<p n="tr">of color still undimmed and leaf unmarred;</p>
<p n="tr">but from the breast of mother-earth no more</p>
<p n="tr">its life doth feed. Then good Aeneas brought</p>
<p n="tr">two broidered robes of scarlet and fine gold,</p>
<p n="tr">which with the gladsome labor of her hands</p>
<p n="tr">Sidonian Dido wrought him long ago,</p>
<p n="tr">the thin-spun gold inweaving. One of these</p>
<p n="tr">the sad prince o'er the youthful body threw</p>
<p n="tr">for parting gift; and with the other veiled</p>
<p n="tr">those tresses from the fire; he heaped on high</p>
<p n="tr">Laurentum's spoils of war, and bade to bring</p>
<p n="tr">much tribute forth: horses and arms he gave,</p>
<p n="tr">seized from the fallen enemy; with hands</p>
<p n="tr">fettered behind them filed a captive train</p>
<p n="tr">doomed to appease the shades, and with the flames</p>
<p n="tr">to mix their flowing blood. He bade his chiefs</p>
<p n="tr">set up the trunks of trees and clothe them well</p>
<p n="tr">with captured arms, inscribing on each one</p>
<p n="tr">some foeman's name. Then came Acoetes forth,</p>
<p n="tr">a wretched, worn old man, who beat his breast</p>
<p n="tr">with tight-clenched hands, and tore his wrinkled face</p>
<p n="tr">with ruthless fingers; oft he cast him down</p>
<p n="tr">full length along the ground. Then lead they forth</p>
<p n="tr">the blood-stained Rutule chariots of war;</p>
<p n="tr">Aethon, the war-horse, of his harness bare,</p>
<p n="tr">walks mournful by; big teardrops wet his cheek.</p>
<p n="tr">Some bear the lance and helm; for all the rest</p>

<p n="tr">a mournful Teucrian cohort; next the host</p>
<p n="tr">Etrurian and the men of Arcady</p>

<p n="tr">Heroic Pallas! be forever blest!</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="card"/>Now envoys from the Latin citadel</p>

<p n="tr">upon the vanquished, the unbreathing slain?</p>
<p n="tr">To people once his hosts and kindred called,</p>
<p n="tr">would he not mercy show? To such a prayer,</p>

<p n="tr">the boon, and this benignant answer made:</p>
<p n="tr">Ye Latins, what misfortune undeserved</p>
<p n="tr">has snared you in so vast a war, that now</p>
<p n="tr">you shun our friendship? Have you here implored</p>
<p n="tr">peace for your dead, by chance of battle fallen?</p>
<p n="tr">Pain would I grant it for the living too.</p>
<p n="tr">I sailed not hither save by Heaven's decree,</p>
<p n="tr">which called me to this land. I wage no war</p>
<p n="tr">with you, the people; 't was your King refused</p>

<p n="tr">to Turnus' arms. More meet and just it were</p>
<p n="tr">had Turnus met this death that makes you mourn.</p>
<p n="tr">If he would end our quarrel sword in hand,</p>

<p n="tr">to cross his blade with mine; that man to whom</p>
<p n="tr">the gods, or his own valor, had decreed</p>

<p n="tr">Beneath your lost friends light the funeral fires!</p>
<p n="tr">So spoke Aeneas; and with wonder mute</p>
<p n="tr">all stood at gaze, each turning to behold</p>

<p n="tr">Is it thy rectitude or strenuous war</p>

<p n="tr">This doom ye bring me was writ long ago,</p>

<p n="tr">built funeral pyres along the winding shore,</p>
<p n="tr">King Tarchon at his side. Each thither brought</p>
<p n="tr">the bodies of his kin, observing well</p>
<p n="tr">all ancient ritual. The fuming fires</p>
<p n="tr">burned from beneath, till highest heaven was hid</p>
<p n="tr">in blackest, overmantling cloud. Three times</p>
<p n="tr">the warriors, sheathed in proud, resplendent steel,</p>
<p n="tr">paced round the kindling pyres; and three times</p>
<p n="tr">fair companies of horsemen circled slow,</p>
<p n="tr">with loud lamenting, round the doleful flame.</p>
<p n="tr">The wail of warriors and the trumpets' blare</p>
<p n="tr">the very welkin rend. Cast on the flames</p>
<p n="tr">are spoils of slaughtered Latins,helms and blades,</p>
<p n="tr">bridles and chariot-wheels. Yet others bring</p>
<p n="tr">gifts to the dead familiar, their own shields</p>
<p n="tr">and unavailing spears. Around them slain</p>
<p n="tr">great herds of kine give tribute unto death:</p>
<p n="tr">swine, bristly-backed, from many a field are borne,</p>
<p n="tr">and slaughtered sheep bleed o'er the sacred fire.</p>
<p n="tr">So on the shore the wailing multitude</p>
<p n="tr">behold their comrades burning, and keep guard</p>
<p n="tr">o'er the consuming pyres, nor turn away</p>
<p n="tr">till cooling night re-shifts the globe of heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">thick-strewn with numberless far-flaming stars.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="203" unit="card"/>Likewise the mournful Latins far away</p>
<p n="tr">have built their myriad pyres. Yet of the slain</p>
<p n="tr">not few in graves are laid, and borne with tears</p>
<p n="tr">to neighboring country-side or native town;</p>
<p n="tr">the restpromiscuous mass of dead unknown</p>
<p n="tr">to nameless and unhonored ashes burn;</p>
<p n="tr">with multitude of fires the far-spread fields</p>
<p n="tr">blaze forth unweariedly. But when from heaven</p>
<p n="tr">the third morn had dispelled the dark and cold,</p>
<p n="tr">the mournful bands raked forth the mingled bones</p>
<p n="tr">and plenteous ashes from the smouldering pyres,</p>
<p n="tr">then heaped with earth the one sepulchral mound.</p>
<p n="tr">Now from the hearth-stones of the opulent town</p>
<p n="tr">of old Latinus a vast wail burst forth,</p>
<p n="tr">for there was found the chief and bitterest share</p>
<p n="tr">of all the woe. For mothers in their tears,</p>
<p n="tr">lone brides, and stricken souls of sisters fond,</p>
<p n="tr">and boys left fatherless, fling curses Ioud</p>
<p n="tr">on Turnus' troth-plight and the direful war:</p>
<p n="tr">Let him, let Turnus, with his single sword</p>
<p n="tr">decide the strife,they cry,and who shall claim</p>
<p n="tr">Lordship of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and power supreme.</p>
<p n="tr">Fierce Drances whets their fury, urging all</p>
<p n="tr">that Turnus singly must the challenge hear,</p>
<p n="tr">and singly wage the war; but others plead</p>
<p n="tr">in Turnus' favor; the Queen's noble name</p>
<p n="tr">protects him, and his high renown in arms</p>
<p n="tr">defends his cause with well-won trophies fair.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="card"/>Amid these tumults of the wrathful throng,</p>
<p n="tr">lo, the ambassadors to Diomed</p>
<p n="tr">arrive with cloudy forehead from their quest</p>
<p n="tr">in his illustrious town; for naught availed</p>
<p n="tr">their toilsome errand, nor the gifts and gold,</p>
<p n="tr">nor strong entreaty. Other help in war</p>
<p n="tr">the Latins now must find, or humbly sue</p>
<p n="tr">peace from the Trojan. At such tidings dire</p>
<p n="tr">even Latinus trembles: Heaven's decrees</p>
<p n="tr">and influence of gods too visible</p>
<p n="tr">sustain Aeneas; so the wrath divine</p>
<p n="tr">and new-filled sepulchres conspicuous</p>
<p n="tr">give warning clear. Therefore the King convenes</p>
<p n="tr">a general council of his captains brave</p>
<p n="tr">beneath the royal towers. They, gathering,</p>
<p n="tr">throng the approaches thither, where their Iord,</p>
<p n="tr">gray-haired Latinus, takes the central throne,</p>
<p n="tr">wearing authority with mournful brow.</p>
<p n="tr">He bids the envoys from Aetolia's King</p>
<p n="tr">sent back, to speak and tell the royal words</p>
<p n="tr">in order due. Forthwith on every tongue</p>
<p n="tr">fell silence, while the princely Venulus,</p>
<p n="tr">heeding his Iord's behest, began the parle:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="243" unit="card"/>My countrymen, he said, our eyes have seen</p>
<p n="tr">strongholds of Greeks and Diomed the King.</p>
<p n="tr">We braved all perils to our journey's end</p>
<p n="tr">and clasped that hand whereof the dreadful stroke</p>
<p n="tr">wrought <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s fall. The hero built a town,</p>
<p n="tr">Argyripa, hereditary name,</p>
<p n="tr">near mount Garganus in Apulian land:</p>
<p n="tr">passing that city's portal and the King's,</p>
<p n="tr">we found free audience, held forth thy gifts,</p>
<p n="tr">and told our names and fatherland. We showed</p>
<p n="tr">what condict was enkindled, and what cause</p>
<p n="tr">brought us to Arpi's King. He, hearing all,</p>
<p n="tr">with brow benign made answer to our plea:</p>
<p n="tr">O happy tribes in Saturn's kingdom born,</p>
<p n="tr">Ausonia's ancient stem! What fortune blind</p>
<p n="tr">tempts ye from peace away, and now ensnares</p>
<p n="tr">in wars unknown? Look how we men that dared</p>
<p n="tr">lay <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName> waste (I speak not of what woes</p>
<p n="tr">in battling neath her lofty walls we bore,</p>
<p n="tr">nor of dead warriors sunk in Simois' wave)</p>
<p n="tr">have paid the penalty in many a land</p>
<p n="tr">with chastisement accurst and changeful woe,</p>
<p n="tr">till Priam's self might pity. Let the star</p>
<p n="tr">of Pallas tell its tale of fatal storm,</p>
<p n="tr">off grim Caphereus and Eubcea's crags.</p>
<p n="tr">Driven asunder from one field of war,</p>
<p n="tr">Atrides unto farthest <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> strayed,</p>
<p n="tr">and wise Ulysses saw from <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>'s caves</p>
<p n="tr">the Cyclops gathering. Why name the throne</p>
<p n="tr">of Pyrrhus, or the violated hearth</p>
<p n="tr">whence fled Idomeneus? Or Locri cast</p>
<p n="tr">on <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>'s distant shore? For even he,</p>
<p n="tr">Lord of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> by the Greeks obeyed,</p>
<p n="tr">fell murdered on his threshold by the hand</p>
<p n="tr">of that polluted wife, whose paramour</p>
<p n="tr">trapped <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>'s conqueror. The envious gods</p>
<p n="tr">withheld me also from returning home</p>
<p n="tr">to see once more the hearth-stone of my sires,</p>
<p n="tr">the wife I yearn for, and my Calydon,</p>
<p n="tr">the beauteous land. For wonders horrible</p>
<p n="tr">pursue me still. My vanished followers</p>
<p n="tr">through upper air take wing, or haunt and rove</p>
<p n="tr">in forms of birds the island waters o'er:</p>
<p n="tr">ah me, what misery my people feel!</p>
<p n="tr">The tall rocks ring with their lament and cry.</p>
<p n="tr">Naught else had I to hope for from that day</p>
<p n="tr">when my infatuate sword on gods I drew,</p>
<p n="tr">and outraged with abominable wound</p>
<p n="tr">the hand of Venus. Urge me not, I pray,</p>
<p n="tr">to conflicts in this wise. No more for me</p>
<p n="tr">of war with Trojans after <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s fall!</p>
<p n="tr">I take no joy in evils past, nor wish</p>
<p n="tr">such memory to renew. Go, lay these gifts,</p>
<p n="tr">brought to my honor from your ancient land,</p>
<p n="tr">at great Aeneas' feet. We twain have stood</p>
<p n="tr">confronting close with swords implacable</p>
<p n="tr">in mortal fray. Believe me, I have known</p>
<p n="tr">the stature of him when he lifts his shield,</p>
<p n="tr">and swings the whirlwind of his spear. If <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></p>
<p n="tr">two more such sons had bred, the Dardan horde</p>

<p n="tr">Our lingering at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s stubborn wall,</p>

<p n="tr">was his and Hector's work. Heroic pair!</p>
<p n="tr">Each one for valor notable, and each</p>
<p n="tr">famous in enterprise of arms,but he</p>
<p n="tr">was first in piety. Enclasp with his</p>
<p n="tr">your hands in plighted peace as best ye may:</p>
<p n="tr">but shock of steel on steel ye well may shun.</p>
<p n="tr">now hast thou heard, good King, a king's reply,</p>
<p n="tr">and how his wisdom sits in this vast war.</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="296" unit="card"/>Soon as the envoys ceased, an answering sound</p>
<p n="tr">of troubled voices through the council flowed</p>
<p n="tr">of various note, as when its rocky bed</p>
<p n="tr">impedes an arrowy stream, and murmurs break</p>
<p n="tr">from the strait-channelled flood; the fringing shores</p>
<p n="tr">repeat the tumult of the clamorous wave.</p>
<p n="tr">But when their hearts and troublous tongues were still,</p>
<p n="tr">the King, invoking first the gods in heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">thus from a Iofty throne his sentence gave:</p>
<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="302" unit="card"/>Less evil were our case, if long ago</p>
<p n="tr">ye had provided for your country's weal,</p>
<p n="tr">O Latins, as I urged. It is no time</p>
<p n="tr">to hold dispute, while, compassing our walls,</p>
<p n="tr">the foeman waits. Ill-omened war is ours </p>
<p n="tr">against a race of gods, my countrymen,</p>
<p n="tr">invincible, unwearied in the fray,</p>
<p n="tr">and who, though lost and fallen, clutch the sword.</p>
<p n="tr">If hope ye cherished of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>'s power,</p>
<p n="tr">dismiss it! For what hope ye have is found</p>
<p n="tr">in your own bosoms only. But ye know</p>
<p n="tr">how slight it is and small. What ruin wide</p>
<p n="tr">has fallen, is now palpable and clear.</p>
<p n="tr">No blame I cast. What valor's uttermost</p>
<p n="tr">may do was done; our kingdom in this war</p>
<p n="tr">strained its last thews. Now therefore I will tell</p>
<p n="tr">such project as my doubtful mind may frame,</p>
<p n="tr">and briefly, if ye give good heed, unfold:</p>
<p n="tr">an ancient tract have I, close-bordering</p>
<p n="tr">the river <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; it runs westward far</p>
<p n="tr">beyond Sicania's bound, and filth it bears</p>
<p n="tr">to Rutule and Auruncan husbandmen,</p>
<p n="tr">who furrow its hard hills or feed their flocks</p>
<p n="tr">along the stonier slopes. Let this demesne,</p>
<p n="tr">together with its pine-clad mountain tall,</p>
<p n="tr">be given the Teucrian for our pledge of peace,</p>
<p n="tr">confirmed by free and equitable league,</p>
<p n="tr">and full alliance with our kingly power.</p>
<p n="tr">Let them abide there, if it please them so,</p>
<p n="tr">and build their city's wall. But if their hearts</p>
<p n="tr">for other land or people yearn, and fate</p>
<p n="tr">permits them hence to go, then let us build</p>
<p n="tr">twice ten good galleys of Italian oak,</p>
<p n="tr">or more, if they can man them. All the wood</p>
<p n="tr">lies yonder on the shore. Let them but say</p>
<p n="tr">how numerous and large the ships they crave,</p>
<p n="tr">and we will give the brass, the artisans,</p>
<p n="tr">and ship-supplies. Let us for envoys choose</p>
<p n="tr">a hundred of the Latins noblest born</p>
<p n="tr">to tell our message and arrange the peace,</p>
<p n="tr">bearing mild olive-boughs and weighty gifts</p>
<p n="tr">of ivory and gold, with chair of state</p>
<p n="tr">and purple robe, our emblems as a king.</p>
<p n="tr">But freely let this council speak; give aid</p>
<p n="tr">to our exhausted cause. <milestone ed="p" n="336" unit="card"/>Then Drances rose,</p>
<p n="tr">that foe inveterate, whom Turnus' fame</p>
<p n="tr">to stinging hate and envy double-tongued</p>
<p n="tr">ever pricked on. Of liberal wealth was he</p>
<p n="tr">and flowing speech, but slack of hand in war</p>
<p n="tr">at council board accounted no weak voice,</p>
<p n="tr">in quarrels stronger still; of lofty birth</p>
<p n="tr">in the maternal line, but by his sire's</p>
<p n="tr">uncertain and obscure. He, claiming place,</p>
<p n="tr">thus multiplies with words the people's ire:</p>
<p n="tr">A course most clear, nor needing voice of mine,</p>
<p n="tr">thy council is, good King; for all men see</p>
<p n="tr">the way of public weal, but smother close</p>
<p n="tr">the telling of it. Turnus must concede</p>
<p n="tr">freedom to speak, and his own arrogance</p>
<p n="tr">diminish! Under his ill-boding star</p>
<p n="tr">and fatal conductyea, I speak it plain,</p>
<p n="tr">though with his naked steel my death he swear</p>
<p n="tr">yon host of princes fell, and we behold</p>
<p n="tr">the whole land bowed with grief; while he assails</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan camp (beating such bold retreats!)</p>
<p n="tr">and troubles Heaven with war. One gift the more,</p>
<p n="tr">among the many to the Trojans given,</p>
<p n="tr">one chiefly, best of kings, thy choice should be.</p>
<p n="tr">Let not wild violence thy will restrain</p>
<p n="tr">from granting, sire, thy virgin daughter's hand</p>
<p n="tr">to son-in-law illustrious, in a match</p>
<p n="tr">worthy of both,and thus the lasting bond</p>
<p n="tr">of peace establish. But if verily</p>
<p n="tr">our hearts and souls be weak with craven fear,</p>
<p n="tr">let us on Turnus call, and grace implore</p>
<p n="tr">even of him. Let him no more oppose;</p>
<p n="tr">but to his country and his King concede</p>
<p n="tr">their natural right. Why wilt thou o'er and o'er</p>
<p n="tr">fling thy poor countrymen in danger's way,</p>
<p n="tr">O chief and fountain of all <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>'s pain?</p>
<p n="tr">War will not save us. Not a voice but sues</p>
<p n="tr">for peace, O Turnus! and, not less than peace,</p>
<p n="tr">its one inviolable pledge. Behold,</p>
<p n="tr">I lead in this petition! even I</p>
<p n="tr">whom thou dost feign thy foe(I waste no words</p>
<p n="tr">denying)look! I supplicate of thee,</p>
<p n="tr">take pity on thy kindred; drop thy pride,</p>
<p n="tr">and get thee home defeated. We have seen</p>
<p n="tr">slaughter enough, enough of funeral flames,</p>
<p n="tr">and many a wide field waste and desolate.</p>
<p n="tr">If glory move thee, if thy martial breast</p>
<p n="tr">so swell with strength, and if a royal dower</p>
<p n="tr">be thy dear dream, go, pluck thy courage up,</p>
<p n="tr">and front thy own brave bosom to the foe.</p>
<p n="tr">for, lo, that Turnus on his wedding day</p>
<p n="tr">may win a princess, our cheap, common lives</p>
<p n="tr">we the mere mob, unwept, unsepulchred</p>

<p n="tr">if there be mettle in thee and some drops</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="376" unit="card"/>By such discourse he stirred the burning blood</p>
<p n="tr">of Turnus, who groaned loud and from his heart</p>
<p n="tr">this utterance hurled: O Drances, thou art rich</p>
<p n="tr">in large words, when the day of battle calls</p>
<p n="tr">for actions. If our senators convene</p>
<p n="tr">thou comest early. But the council hall</p>
<p n="tr">is not for swollen talk, such as thy tongue</p>

<p n="tr">hold back thy foes, and ere the trenches flow</p>

<p n="tr">Brand me a coward, Drances, when thy sword</p>

<p n="tr">is not so far to seek; around yon wall</p>

<p n="tr">Why art thou tarrying? Wilt thou linger here,</p>

<p n="tr">who, rather than behold such things, has fallen</p>
<p n="tr">face forward, dead, his teeth upon the dust.</p>
<p n="tr">But if we still have power, and men-at-arms</p>
<p n="tr">unwasted and unscathed, if there survive</p>
<p n="tr">Italian tribes and towns for help in war,</p>

<p n="tr">far o'er the vocal marish fling their song.</p>
<p n="tr">Then, seizing the swift moment, Turnus cried:</p>
<p n="tr">Once more, my countrymen,ye sit in parle,</p>
<p n="tr">lazily praising peace, while yonder foe</p>
<p n="tr">speeds forth in arms our kingdom to obtain.</p>
<p n="tr">He spoke no more, but hied him in hot haste,</p>

<p n="tr">Equip the Volscian companies! Lead forth</p>
<p n="tr">my Rutules also! O'er the spreading plain,</p>
<p n="tr">ye brothers Coras and Messapus range</p>
<p n="tr">our host of cavalry! Let others guard</p>
<p n="tr">the city's gates and hold the walls and towers:</p>
<p n="tr">I and my followers elsewhere oppose</p>
<p n="tr">the shock of arms. <milestone ed="p" n="468" unit="card"/>Now to and fro they run</p>
<p n="tr">to man the walls. Father Latinus quits</p>
<p n="tr">the place of council and his large design,</p>
<p n="tr">vexed and bewildered by the hour's distress.</p>
<p n="tr">He blames his own heart that he did not ask</p>
<p n="tr">Trojan Aeneas for his daughter's Iord,</p>
<p n="tr">and gain him for his kingdom's lasting friend.</p>
<p n="tr">They dig them trenches at the gates, or lift</p>
<p n="tr">burden of stakes and stones. The horn's harsh note</p>
<p n="tr">sounds forth its murderous signal for the war;</p>
<p n="tr">striplings and women, in a motley ring,</p>
<p n="tr">defend the ramparts; the decisive hour</p>
<p n="tr">lays tasks on all. Upon the citadel</p>
<p n="tr">a train of matrons, with the doleful Queen,</p>
<p n="tr">toward Pallas' temple moves, and in their hand</p>
<p n="tr">are gifts and offerings. See, at their side</p>
<p n="tr">the maid Lavinia, cause of all these tears,</p>
<p n="tr">drops down her lovely eyes! The incense rolls</p>
<p n="tr">in clouds above the altar; at the doors</p>
<p n="tr">with wailing voice the women make this prayer:</p>
<p n="tr">Tritonian virgin, arbitress of war!</p>
<p n="tr">Break of thyself yon Phrygian robber's spear!</p>
<p n="tr">Hurl him down dying in the dust! Spill forth</p>
<p n="tr">his evil blood beneath our lofty towers!</p>
<p n="tr">Fierce Turnus girds him, emulous to slay:</p>

<p n="tr">the golden greaves; upon his naked brow</p>

<p n="tr">runs he, a golden glory, in his heart</p>
<p n="tr">boldly exulting, while impatient hope</p>

<p n="tr">or tries him to a herd of feeding mares,</p>

<p n="tr">at her example glided to the ground,</p>
<p n="tr">their horses leaving. Thus the virgin spoke:</p>
<p n="tr">Turnus, if confidence beseem the brave,</p>
<p n="tr">I have no fear; but of myself do vow</p>
<p n="tr">to meet yon squadrons of Aeneadae</p>
<p n="tr">alone, and front me to the gathered charge</p>

<p n="tr">the war's first venture-prove. Take station, thou,</p>
<p n="tr">here at the walls, this rampart to defend.</p>
<p n="tr">With fixed eyes on the terror-striking maid,</p>
<p n="tr">Turnus replied, O boast of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,</p>
<p n="tr">O virgin bold! What praise, what gratitude</p>
<p n="tr">can words or deeds repay? But since thy soul</p>
<p n="tr">so large of stature shows, I bid thee share</p>
<p n="tr">my burden and my war. Our spies bring news</p>
<p n="tr">that now Aeneas with pernicious mind</p>
<p n="tr">sends light-armed horse before him, to alarm</p>
<p n="tr">the plains below, while through the wilderness</p>
<p n="tr">he climbs the steep hills, and approaches so</p>
<p n="tr">our leaguered town. But I in sheltered grove</p>
<p n="tr">a stratagem prepare, and bid my men</p>
<p n="tr">in ambush at a mountain cross-road lie.</p>
<p n="tr">Meet thou the charge of Tuscan cavalry</p>

<p n="tr">take bold Messapus with his Latin troop</p>
<p n="tr">and King Tiburtus' men: but the command</p>
<p n="tr">shall be thy task and care. He spoke, and urged</p>
<p n="tr">with like instruction for the coming fray</p>
<p n="tr">Messapus and his captains; then advanced</p>
<p n="tr">to meet the foe. <milestone ed="p" n="522" unit="card"/>There is a winding vale</p>
<p n="tr">for armed deception and insidious war</p>
<p n="tr">well fashioned, and by interlacing leaves</p>

<p n="tr">or, standing on the ridges, to roll down</p>

<p n="tr">Camilla now to cruel conflict flies;</p>
<p n="tr">with weapons like my own she girds her side,</p>
<p n="tr">in vain, though dearest of all nymphs to me.</p>
<p n="tr">Nor is it some new Iove that stirs to-day</p>
<p n="tr">with sudden sweetness in Diana's breast:</p>
<p n="tr">for long ago, when from his kingdom driven,</p>
<p n="tr">for insolent and envied power, her sire</p>
<p n="tr">King Metabus, from old <placeName key="perseus,Privernum">Privernum</placeName>'s wall</p>
<p n="tr">was taking flight amidst opposing foes,</p>
<p n="tr">he bore a little daughter in his arms</p>
<p n="tr">to share his exile; and he called the child</p>
<p n="tr">(Changing Casmilla, her queen-mother's name)</p>
<p n="tr">Camilla. Bearing on his breast the babe,</p>
<p n="tr">he fled to solitary upland groves.</p>
<p n="tr">But hovering round him with keen lances, pressed</p>
<p n="tr">the Volscian soldiery. Across his path,</p>

<p n="tr">restrained him, trembling for his burden dear.</p>
<p n="tr">In his perplexed heart suddenly arose</p>
<p n="tr">firm resolve. It chanced the warrior bore</p>
<p n="tr">huge spear in his brawny hand, strong shaft</p>
<p n="tr">of knotted, seasoned oak; to this he lashed</p>
<p n="tr">his little daughter with a withe of bark</p>
<p n="tr">pulled from a cork-tree, and with skilful bonds</p>
<p n="tr">fast bound her to the spear; then, poising it</p>
<p n="tr">high in his right hand, thus he called on Heaven:</p>

<p n="tr">she flies a suppliant to thee! Receive,</p>
<p n="tr">O goddess, I implore, what now I cast</p>
<p n="tr">upon the perilous air.He spoke, and hurled</p>
<p n="tr">with lifted arm the whirling shaft. The waves</p>
<p n="tr">roared loud, as on the whistling javelin</p>
<p n="tr">hapless Camilla crossed th' impetuous flood.</p>
<p n="tr">But Metabus, his foes in hot pursuit,</p>
<p n="tr">dared plunge him in mid-stream, and, triumphing,</p>
<p n="tr">soon plucked from grass-grown river-bank the spear,</p>

<p n="tr">a virgin offering. Him nevermore</p>
<p n="tr">could cities hold, nor would his wild heart yield</p>
<p n="tr">its sylvan freedom, but his days were passed</p>
<p n="tr">with shepherds on the solitary hills.</p>
<p n="tr">His daughter too in tangled woods he bred:</p>
<p n="tr">a brood-mare from the milk of her fierce breast</p>
<p n="tr">suckled the child, and to its tender lips</p>
<p n="tr">.Her udders moved; and when the infant feet</p>
<p n="tr">their first firm steps had taken, the small palms</p>
<p n="tr">were armed with a keen javelin; her sire</p>
<p n="tr">a bow and quiver from her shoulder slung.</p>
<p n="tr">Instead of golden combs and flowing pall,</p>
<p n="tr">she wore, from her girl-forehead backward thrown,</p>
<p n="tr">the whole skin of a tigress; with soft hands</p>
<p n="tr">she made her plaything of a whirling spear,</p>
<p n="tr">or, swinging round her head the polished thong</p>
<p n="tr">of her good sling, she fetched from distant sky</p>
<p n="tr">Strymonian cranes or swans of spotless wing.</p>
<p n="tr">From Tuscan towns proud matrons oft in vain</p>
<p n="tr">sought her in marriage for their sons; but she</p>
<p n="tr">to Dian only turned her stainless heart,</p>
<p n="tr">her virgin freedom and her huntress' arms</p>
<p n="tr">with faithful passion serving. Would that now</p>
<p n="tr">this Iove of war had ne'er seduced her mind</p>
<p n="tr">the Teucrians to provoke! So might she be</p>
<p n="tr">one of our wood-nymphs still. But haste, I pray,</p>
<p n="tr">for bitter is her now impending doom.</p>
<p n="tr">Descend, dear nymph, from heaven, and explore</p>

<p n="tr">Then, in a cloud concealed, I will consign</p>

<p n="tr">dashed into the mid-fray, where, frenzy-driven,</p>
<p n="tr">he sought out Venulus, and, grappling him</p>
<p n="tr">with one hand, from the saddle snatched his foe,</p>
<p n="tr">and, clasping strongly to his giant breast,</p>
<p n="tr">exultant bore away. The shouting rose</p>
<p n="tr">to heaven, and all the Latins gazed his way,</p>
<p n="tr">as o'er the plain the fiery Tarchon flew</p>
<p n="tr">bearing the full-armed man; then, breaking off</p>
<p n="tr">the point of his own spear, he pried a way</p>
<p n="tr">through the seam'd armor for the mortal wound;</p>
<p n="tr">the other, struggling, thrust back from his throat</p>
<p n="tr">the griping hand, full force to force opposing.</p>
<p n="tr">As when a golden eagle high in air</p>
<p n="tr">knits to a victimsnake his clinging feet</p>

<p n="tr">the wounded serpent roughens his stiff scales</p>
<p n="tr">and stretches high his hissing head; whereat</p>
<p n="tr">the eagle with hooked beak the more doth rend</p>
<p n="tr">her writhing foe, and with swift stroke of wing</p>
<p n="tr">lashes the air: so Tarchon, from the ranks</p>

<p n="tr">The Tuscans rallied now, well pleased to view</p>
<p n="tr">their king's example and successful war.</p>
<p n="tr">Then Arruns, marked for doom, made circling line</p>
<p n="tr">around Camilla's path, his crafty spear</p>
<p n="tr">seeking its lucky chance. Where'er the maid</p>

<p n="tr">in silence dogged her footsteps and pursued;</p>
<p n="tr">or where triumphant from her fallen foes</p>
<p n="tr">she backward drew, the warrior stealthily</p>
<p n="tr">turned his swift reins that way: from every side</p>
<p n="tr">he circled her, and scanned his vantage here</p>
<p n="tr">or vantage there, his skilful javelin</p>
<p n="tr">stubbornly shaking. <milestone ed="p" n="768" unit="card"/>But it soon befell</p>
<p n="tr">that Chloreus, once a priest of Cybele,</p>
<p n="tr">shone forth in far-resplendent Phrygian arms,</p>
<p n="tr">and urged a foaming steed, which wore a robe</p>
<p n="tr">o'erwrought with feathery scales of bronze and gold;</p>
<p n="tr">while he, in purples of fine foreign stain,</p>
<p n="tr">bore light Gortynian shafts and Lycian bow;</p>
<p n="tr">his bow was gold; a golden casque he wore</p>
<p n="tr">upon his priestly brow; the saffron cloak,</p>
<p n="tr">all folds of rustling cambric, was enclasped</p>
<p n="tr">in glittering gold; his skirts and tunics gay</p>
<p n="tr">were broidered, and the oriental garb</p>
<p n="tr">swathed his whole leg. Him when the maiden spied,</p>
<p n="tr">(Perchance she fain on temple walls would hang</p>
<p n="tr">the Trojan prize, or in such captured gold</p>
<p n="tr">her own fair shape array), she gave mad chase,</p>
<p n="tr">and reckless through the ranks her prey pursued,</p>
<p n="tr">desiring, woman-like, the splendid spoil.</p>
<p n="tr">Then from his ambush Arruns seized at last</p>
<p n="tr">the fatal moment and let speed his shaft,</p>
<p n="tr">thus uttering his vow to heavenly powers:</p>
<p n="tr">Chief of the gods, Apollo, who dost guard</p>

<p n="tr">and deep in glowing embers plant our feet.</p>
<p n="tr">O Sire Omnipotent, may this my spear</p>
<p n="tr">our foul disgrace put by. I do not ask</p>
<p n="tr">for plunder, spoils, or trophies in my name,</p>
<p n="tr">when yonder virgin falls; let honor's crown</p>
<p n="tr">be mine for other deeds. But if my stroke</p>

<p n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="794" unit="card"/>Apollo heard and granted half the prayer,</p>
<p n="tr">but half upon the passing breeze he threw:</p>
<p n="tr">granting his votary he should confound</p>
<p n="tr">Camilla by swift death; but 't was denied</p>
<p n="tr">the mountain-fatherland once more to see,</p>
<p n="tr">or safe return,that prayer th' impetuous winds</p>
<p n="tr">swept stormfully away. Soon as the spear</p>
<p n="tr">whizzed from his hand, straight-speeding on the air,</p>
<p n="tr">the Volscians all turned eager thought and eyes</p>
<p n="tr">toward their Queen. She only did not heed</p>
<p n="tr">that windy roar, nor weapon dropped from heaven,</p>
<p n="tr">till in her bare, protruded breast the spear</p>
<p n="tr">drank, deeply driven, of her virgin blood.</p>
<p n="tr">Her terror-struck companians swiftly throng</p>
<p n="tr">around her, and uplift their sinking Queen.</p>
<p n="tr">But Arruns, panic-stricken more than all,</p>
<p n="tr">makes off, half terror and half joy, nor dares</p>
<p n="tr">hazard his lance again, nor dares oppose</p>
<p n="tr">a virgin's arms. As creeps back to the hills</p>
<p n="tr">in pathless covert ere his foes pursue,</p>
<p n="tr">from shepherd slain or mighty bull laid low,</p>
<p n="tr">some wolf, who, now of his bold trespass ware,</p>
<p n="tr">curls close against his paunch a quivering tail</p>
<p n="tr">and to the forest tries: so Arruns speeds</p>
<p n="tr">from sight of men in terror, glad to fly,</p>
<p n="tr">and hides him in the crowd. But his keen spear</p>
<p n="tr">dying Camilla from her bosom drew,</p>
<p n="tr">though the fixed barb of deeply-wounding steel</p>
<p n="tr">clung to the rib. She sank to earth undone,</p>
<p n="tr">her cold eyes closed in death, and from her cheeks</p>
<p n="tr">the roses fled. With failing breath she called</p>
<p n="tr">on Accawho of all her maiden peers</p>
<p n="tr">was chiefly dear and shared her heart's whole pain</p>
<p n="tr">and thus she spoke: O Acca, sister mine,</p>
<p n="tr">I have been strong till now. The cruel wound</p>
<p n="tr">consumes me, and my world is growing dark.</p>
<p n="tr">Haste thee to Turnus! Tell my dying words!</p>
<p n="tr">'T is he must bear the battle and hold back</p>

<p n="tr">So saying, her fingers from the bridle-rein</p>
<p n="tr">unclasped, and helpless to the earth she fell;</p>
<p n="tr">then, colder grown, she loosed her more and more</p>
<p n="tr">out of the body's coil; she gave to death</p>
<p n="tr">her neck, her drooping head, and ceased to heed</p>

<p n="tr">his javelin, running forward. The strong shaft</p>

<p n="tr">rose angrily to heaven, in iron rain</p>
<p n="tr">down-pouring: while the priests bore far away</p>

<p n="tr">infuriate, a javelin in his hand,</p>
<p n="tr">and, towering o'er the suppliant, smote him strong</p>

<p n="tr">full in his face: the big beard quickly blazed</p>
<p n="tr">with smell of singeing; while the warrior bold</p>

<p n="tr">Aeneas, gashed and bleeding, whose long lance</p>

<p n="tr">Iulus, sorrowing. The aged man</p>
<p n="tr">gathered his garments up as leeches do,</p>

<p n="tr">bustled in vain; in vain his surgery</p>
<p n="tr">pried at the shaft, and with a forceps strong</p>
<p n="tr">seized on the buried barb. But Fortune gave</p>
<p n="tr">no remedy, nor did Apollo aid</p>
<p n="tr">his votary. So more and more grim fear</p>
<p n="tr">stalks o'er the field of war, and nearer hies</p>

<p n="tr">in wonder at the lordly citadel.</p>
<p n="tr">For, lo, a pointed peak of flame uprolled</p>

<p n="tr">bent o'er it, and would wrench his weapon free,</p>
<p n="tr">and follow with a far-flung javelin</p>
<p n="tr">the swift out-speeding foe. But Turnus then,</p>

<p n="tr">O Faunus, pity me and heed my prayer!</p>

<p n="tr">what license to the dauntless nymph was given,</p>
<p n="tr">herself came near, and plucked from that deep root</p>
<p n="tr">the javelin forth. So both with lofty mien</p>
<p n="tr">strode forth new-armed, new-hearted: one made bold</p>
<p n="tr">by his good sword, the other, spear in hand,</p>

<p n="tr">Else shouldst thou not behold me at this hour</p>

<p n="tr">Yea, 't was my motion thrust Juturna forth</p>

<p n="tr">but bade no whirl of spear nor bending bow:</p>
<p n="tr">I swear it by th' inexorable fount</p>
<p n="tr">whence flow the Stygian rivers, the sole seat</p>
<p n="tr">where gods of light bow down in awful prayer.</p>
<p n="tr">I yield me now; heart-sick I quit the war.</p>
<p n="tr">But ask one boon, which in the book of fate</p>
<p n="tr">is not denied; for <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>'s good I sue,</p>
<p n="tr">and high prerogatives of men that be</p>
<p n="tr">thy kith and kin: when happy wedlock vows</p>
<p n="tr">(aye, be it so!) shall join them by strong laws</p>
<p n="tr">of chartered peace, let not the Latins Iose</p>
<p n="tr">their ancient, native name. Bid them not pass</p>
<p n="tr">for Trojans, nor be hailed as Teucer's sons;</p>
<p n="tr">no alien speech, no alien garb impose.</p>
<p n="tr">Let it be <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> ever; let the lords</p>

<p n="tr">let the strong, master blood of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> receive</p>

<p n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> perished: let its name and glory die!</p>
<p n="tr">The Author of mankind and all that is,</p>

<p n="tr">Jove's sister true, and Saturn's second child,</p>
<p n="tr">what seas of anger vex thy heart divine!</p>
<p n="tr">But come, relinquish thy rash, fruitless rage:</p>
<p n="tr">I give thee this desire, and yield to thee</p>
<p n="tr">free submission. The Ausonian tribes</p>
<p n="tr">shall keep the speech and customs of their sires;</p>
<p n="tr">the name remains as now; the Teucrian race,</p>
<p n="tr">abiding in the land, shall but infuse</p>
<p n="tr">the mixture of its blood. I will bestow</p>
<p n="tr">a league of worship, and to Latins give</p>

<p n="tr">So Juno bowed consent, and let her will</p>

<p n="tr">Two plagues there be, called Furies, which were spawned</p>

<p n="tr">Soon as she spied the Teucrians in array</p>
<p n="tr">and Turnus' lines, she shrivelled to the shape</p>
<p n="tr">of that small bird which on lone tombs and towers</p>

<p n="tr">In such disguise the Fury, screaming shrill,</p>

<p n="tr">smote on his hollow shield. A strange affright</p>
<p n="tr">palsied his every limb; each several hair</p>

<p n="tr">she marred her cheeks and beat her naked breast. </p>
<p n="tr">What remedy or help, my Turnus, now</p>

<p n="tr">is not a foot-race, but the wrathful strife</p>
