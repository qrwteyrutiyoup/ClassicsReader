<lg type="stanza"><p>Maecenas, born of monarch ancestors,</p>
<p>The shield at once and glory of my life!</p>
<p>There are who joy them in the Olympic strife</p>
<p>And love the dust they gather in the course;</p></lg>
<lg><p>The goal by hot wheels shunn'd, the famous prize,</p>
<p>Exalt them to the gods that rule mankind;</p>
<p>This joys, if rabbles fickle as the wind</p>
<p>Through triple grade of honours bid him rise,</p></lg>
<lg><p>That, if his granary has stored away</p>
<p>Of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>'s thousand floors the yield entire;</p>
<p>The man who digs his field as did his sire,</p>
<p>With honest pride, no Attalus may sway</p></lg>
<lg><p>By proffer'd wealth to tempt Myrtoan seas,</p>
<p>The timorous captain of a Cyprian bark.</p>
<p>The winds that make Icarian billows dark</p>
<p>The merchant fears, and hugs the rural ease</p></lg>
<lg><p>Of his own village home; but soon, ashamed</p>
<p>Of penury, he refits his batter'd craft.</p>
<p>There is, who thinks no scorn of Massic draught,</p>
<p>Who robs the daylight of an hour unblamed,</p></lg>
<lg><p>Now stretch'd beneath the arbute on the sward,</p>
<p>Now by some gentle river's sacred spring;</p>
<p>Some love the camp, the clarion's joyous ring,</p>
<p>And battle, by the mother's soul abhorr'd.</p></lg>
<lg><p>See, patient waiting in the clear keen air,</p>
<p>The hunter, thoughtless of his delicate bride,</p>
<p>Whether the trusty hounds a stag have eyed,</p>
<p>Or the fierce Marsian boar has burst the snare.</p></lg>
<lg><p>To me the artist's meed, the ivy wreath</p>
<p>Is very heaven: me the sweet cool of woods,</p>
<p>Where Satyrs frolic with the Nymphs, secludes</p>
<p>From rabble rout, so but Euterpe's breath</p></lg>
<lg><p>Fail not the flute, nor Polyhymnia fly</p>
<p>Averse from stringing new the Lesbian lyre.</p>
<p>O, write my name among that minstrel choir,</p>
<p>And my proud head shall strike upon the sky!</p></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="2" met="aaab">
<lg><p>Enough of snow and hail at last</p>
<p>The sire has sent in vengeance down:</p>
<p>His bolts, at his own temple cast,</p>
<p>Appall'd the town,</p></lg>
<lg><p>Appall'd the lands, lest <placeName key="perseus,Pyrrha">Pyrrha</placeName>'s time</p>
<p>Return, with all its monstrous sights,</p>
<p>When Proteus led his flocks to climb</p>
<p>The flatten'd heights,</p></lg>
<lg><p>When fish were in the elm-tops caught,</p>
<p>Where once the stock-dove wont to bide,</p>
<p>And does were floating, all distraught,</p>
<p>Adown the tide.</p></lg>
<lg><p>Old <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, hurl'd in tumult back</p>
<p>From mingling with the Etruscan main,</p>
<p>Has threaten'd Numa's court with wrack</p>
<p>And Vesta's fane.</p></lg>
<lg><p>Roused by his <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Ilia</placeName>'s plaintive woes,</p>
<p>He vows revenge for guiltless blood,</p>
<p>And, spite of Jove, his banks o'erflows,</p>
<p>Uxorious flood.</p></lg>
<lg><p>Yes, Fame shall tell of civic steel</p>
<p>That better Persian lives had spilt,</p>
<p>To youths, whose minish'd numbers feel</p>
<p>Their parents' guilt.</p></lg>
<lg><p>What god shall <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> invoke to stay</p>
<p>Her fall? Can suppliance overbear</p>
<p>The ear of Vesta, turn'd away</p>
<p>From chant and prayer?</p></lg>
<lg><p>Who comes, commission'd to atone</p>
<p>For crime like ours? at length appear,</p>
<p>A cloud round thy bright shoulders thrown,</p>
<p>Apollo seer!</p></lg>
<lg><p>Or Venus, laughter-loving dame,</p>
<p>Round whom gay Loves and Pleasures fly;</p>
<p>Or thou, if slighted sons may claim</p>
<p>A parent's eye,</p></lg>
<lg><p>O weary with thy long, long game,</p>
<p>Who lov'st fierce shouts and helmets bright,</p>
<p>And Moorish warrior's glance of flame</p>
<p>Or e'er he smite!</p></lg>
<lg><p>Or <placeName key="tgn,1049816">Maia</placeName>'s son, if now awhile</p>
<p>In youthful guise we see thee here,</p>
<p>Caesar's avenger—such the style</p>
<p>Thou deign'st to bear;</p></lg>
<lg><p>Late be thy journey home, and long</p>
<p>Thy sojourn with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>'s family;</p>
<p>Nor let thy wrath at our great wrong</p>
<p>Lend wings to fly.</p></lg>
<lg><p>Here take our homage, Chief and Sire;</p>
<p>Here wreathe with bay thy conquering brow,</p>
<p>And bid the prancing <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName> retire,</p>
<p>Our Caesar thou!</p></lg></div2>

<lg><p>Thus may <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>' heavenly queen,</p>
<p>Thus Helen's brethren, stars of brightest sheen,</p>
<p>Guide thee!  May the sire of wind</p>
<p>Each truant gale, save only Zephyr, bind!</p>
<p>So do thou, fair ship, that ow'st</p>
<p>Virgil, thy precious freight, to Attic coast,</p>
<p>Safe restore thy loan and whole,</p>
<p>And save from death the partner of my soul!</p>
<p>Oak and brass of triple fold</p>
<p>Encompass'd sure that heart, which first made bold</p>
<p>To the raging sea to trust</p>
<p>A fragile bark, nor fear'd the Afric gust</p>
<p>With its Northern mates at strife,</p>
<p>Nor Hyads' frown, nor South-wind fury-rife,</p>
<p>Mightiest power that <placeName key="perseus,Hadria">Hadria</placeName> knows,</p>
<p>Wills he the waves to madden or compose.</p>
<p>What had Death in store to awe</p>
<p>Those eyes, that huge sea-beasts unmelting saw,</p>
<p>Saw the swelling of the surge,</p>
<p>And high Ceraunian cliffs, the seaman's scourge?</p>
<p>Heaven's high providence in vain</p>
<p>Has sever'd countries with the estranging main,</p>
<p>If our vessels ne'ertheless</p>
<p>With reckless plunge that sacred bar transgress.</p>
<p>Daring all, their goal to win,</p>
<p>Men tread forbidden ground, and rush on sin:</p>
<p>Daring all, Prometheus play'd</p>
<p>His wily game, and fire to man convey'd;</p>
<p>Soon as fire was stolen away,</p>
<p>Pale Fever's stranger host and wan Decay</p>
<p>Swept o'er earth's polluted face,</p>
<p>And slow Fate quicken'd Death's once halting pace.</p>
<p>Daedalus the void air tried</p>
<p>On wings, to humankind by Heaven denied;</p>
<p><placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>'s bar gave way with ease</p>
<p>Before the arm of labouring Hercules.</p>
<p>Nought is there for man too high;</p>
<p>Our impious folly e'en would climb the sky,</p>
<p>Braves the dweller on the steep,</p>
<p>Nor lets the bolts of heavenly vengeance sleep.</p></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="4" met="ab">
<lg><p>The touch of Zephyr and of Spring has loosen'd Winter's thrall;</p>
<p>The well-dried keels are wheel'd again to sea:</p>
<p>The ploughman cares not for his fire, nor cattle for their stall,</p>
<p>And frost no more is whitening all the lea.</p>
<p>Now Cytherea leads the dance, the bright moon overhead;</p>
<p>The Graces and the Nymphs, together knit,</p>
<p>With rhythmic feet the meadow beat, while <placeName key="tgn,1050339">Vulcan</placeName>, fiery red,</p>
<p>Heats the Cyclopian forge in <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>'s pit.</p>
<p>'Tis now the time to wreathe the brow with branch of myrtle green,</p>
<p>Or flowers, just opening to the vernal breeze;</p>
<p>Now Faunus claims his sacrifice among the shady treen,</p>
<p>Lambkin or kidling, which soe'er he please.</p>
<p>Pale Death, impartial, walks his round: he knocks at cottage-gate</p>
<p>And palace-portal.  Sestius, child of bliss!</p>
<p>How should a mortal's hopes be long, when short his being's date?</p>
<p>Lo here! the fabulous ghosts, the dark abyss,</p>
<p>The void of the Plutonian hall, where soon as e'er you go,</p>
<p>No more for you shall leap the auspicious die</p>
<p>To seat you on the throne of wine; no more your breast shall glow</p>
<p>For Lycidas, the star of every eye.</p></lg></div2>

<lg><p>What slender youth, besprinkled with perfume,</p>
<p>Courts you on roses in some grotto's shade?</p>
<p>Fair <placeName key="perseus,Pyrrha">Pyrrha</placeName>, say, for whom</p>
<p>Your yellow hair you braid,</p></lg>
<lg><p>So trim, so simple! Ah! how oft shall he</p>
<p>Lament that faith can fail, that gods can change,</p>
<p>Viewing the rough black sea</p>
<p>With eyes to tempests strange,</p></lg>
<lg><p>Who now is basking in your golden smile,</p>
<p>And dreams of you still fancy-free, still kind,</p>
<p>Poor fool, nor knows the guile</p>
<p>Of the deceitful wind!</p></lg>
<lg><p>Woe to the eyes you dazzle without cloud</p>
<p>Untried! For me, they show in yonder fane</p>
<p>My dripping garments, vow'd</p>
<p>To Him who curbs the main.</p></lg></div2>

<lg><p>Not I, but Varius:—he, of Homer's brood</p>
<p>A tuneful swan, shall bear you on his wing,</p>
<p>Your tale of trophies, won by field or flood,</p>
<p>Mighty alike to sing.</p></lg>
<lg><p>Not mine such themes, Agrippa; no, nor mine</p>
<p>To chant the Wrath that fill'd Pelides' breast,</p>
<p>Nor dark Ulysses' wanderings o'er the brine,</p>
<p>Nor Pelops' house unblest.</p></lg>
<lg><p>Vast were the task, I feeble; inborn shame,</p>
<p>And she, who makes the peaceful lyre submit,</p>
<p>Forbid me to impair great Caesar's fame</p>
<p>And yours by my weak wit.</p></lg>
<lg><p>But who may fitly sing of Mars array'd</p>
<p>In adamant mail, or Merion, black with dust</p>
<p>Of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, or Tydeus' son by <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName>' aid</p>
<p>Strong against gods to thrust?</p></lg>
<lg><p>Feasts are my theme, my warriors maidens fair,</p>
<p>Who with pared nails encounter youths in fight;</p>

<p>No more despair; Apollo's word is true.</p>
<p>Another <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in kindlier air</p>

<p>Let Necessity but drive</p>
<p>Her wedge of adamant into that proud head,</p>
<p>Vainly battling will you strive</p>

<p>There the step-dame keeps her hand</p>

<p>Living worth we envy still,</p>
<p>Then seek it with strain'd eyes, when snatch'd from sight.</p>
<p>What can sad laments avail</p>
<p>Unless sharp justice kill the taint of sin?</p>
<p>What can laws, that needs must fail</p>
<p>Shorn of the aid of manners form'd within,</p>
<p>If the merchant turns not back</p>
<p>From the fierce heats that round the tropic glow,</p>
<p>Turns not from the regions black</p>
<p>With northern winds, and hard with frozen snow;</p>
<p>Sailors override the wave,</p>
<p>While guilty poverty, more fear'd than vice.</p>
<p>Bids us crime and suffering brave,</p>
<p>And shuns the ascent of virtue's precipice?</p>
<p>Let the Capitolian fane,</p>
<p>The favour'd goal of yon vociferous crowd,</p>
<p>Aye, or let the nearest main</p>
<p>Receive our gold, our jewels rich and proud:</p>
<p>Slay we thus the cause of crime,</p>
<p>If yet we would repent and choose the good:</p>
<p>Ours the task to take in time</p>
<p>This baleful lust, and crush it in the bud.</p>
<p>Ours to mould our weakling sons</p>
<p>To nobler sentiment and manlier deed:</p>
<p>Now the noble's first-born shuns</p>
<p>The perilous chase, nor learns to sit his steed:</p>
<p>Set him to the unlawful dice,</p>
<p>Or Grecian hoop, how skilfully he plays!</p>
<p>While his sire, mature in vice,</p>
<p>A friend, a partner, or a guest betrays,</p>
<p>Hurrying, for an heir so base,</p>
<p>To gather riches.  Money, root of ill,</p>
<p>Doubt it not, still grows apace:</p>
<p>Yet the scant heap has somewhat lacking still.</p></lg></div2>

<p>That race, like oak by axes shorn</p>
<p>On Algidus with dark leaves rife,</p>
<p>Laughs carnage, havoc, all to scorn,</p>
